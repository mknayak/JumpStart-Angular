      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The US economy is struggling to find a new formula for vigorous growth. But all growth opportunities are not created equal. New McKinsey research pinpoints five catalysts&mdash;in energy, trade, technology, infrastructure, and talent development&mdash;that can quickly create jobs and deliver a substantial boost to GDP by 2020. An animated video below also runs the numbers on these game changers and frames the challenge for business and government to make the most of the opportunity.</p>

<p>Four years after the official end of the Great Recession, US economic growth remains lackluster. But there is more at work here than simply the business cycle: strains in the labor market were apparent long before 2008. Today, labor-force participation is at a 34-year low, and the United States has two million fewer jobs than it did when the recession began. Weak investment, demographic shifts, and a slowdown in productivity growth are dampening the economy&rsquo;s trajectory.</p>

		</video>
    </figure><p>But the United States does not have to resign itself to sluggish growth. <em>Game changers: Five opportunities for US growth and renewal</em>, a new report from the McKinsey Global Institute (MGI), identifies specific catalysts that can add hundreds of billions of dollars to annual GDP and create millions of new jobs by 2020. </p>
<p>To identify these catalysts, MGI looked for developments that are poised to achieve scale immediately and could accelerate growth across multiple sectors by 2020. We also focused on areas with an immediate window for action. </p>
<p><em>Game changers</em> zeroes in on five mutually reinforcing opportunities: </p>
<ul class="bullListSep">
    <li><span class="mck_h3_sm"><h3>Shale-gas and -oil production.</span> Powered by advances in horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing, the production of domestic shale gas and oil has grown more than 50 percent annually since 2007. The shale boom could add as much as $690 billion a year to GDP and create up to 1.7 million jobs across the economy by 2020. The impact will extend to energy-intensive manufacturing industries and beyond. The United States now has the potential to reduce net energy imports to zero&mdash;but only if it can successfully address the associated environmental risks.&nbsp; </h3></span>
    <li><span class="mck_h3_sm"><h3>US trade competitiveness in knowledge-intensive goods.</span> The United States is one of the few advanced economies running a trade deficit in knowledge-intensive industries. But changing factor costs, a rebound in demand, and currency shifts are creating an opening to increase US production and exports of knowledge-intensive goods, such as automobiles, commercial airliners, medical devices, and petrochemicals. By implementing five strategies to boost competitiveness in these sectors, we believe the United States could reduce the trade deficit in knowledge-intensive industries to its 2000 level or close it&mdash;which would add up to $590 billion in annual GDP by 2020 and create up to 1.8 million new jobs. </h3></span>
    <li><span class="mck_h3_sm"><h3>Big-data analytics as a productivity tool.</span> Sectors across the economy can harness the deluge of data generated by transactions, medical and legal records, videos, and social technologies&mdash;not to mention the sensors, cameras, bar codes, and transmitters embedded in the world around us. Advances in computing and analytics can transform this sea of data into insights that create operational efficiencies. By 2020, the wider adoption of big-data analytics could increase annual GDP in retailing and manufacturing by up to $325 billion and save as much as $285 billion in the cost of health care and government services. </h3></span>
    <li><span class="mck_h3_sm"><h3>Increased investment in infrastructure, with a new emphasis on productivity.</span> The backlog of maintenance and upgrades for US roads, highways, bridges, and transit and water systems is reaching critical levels. The United States must increase its annual infrastructure investment by one percentage point of GDP to erase this competitive disadvantage. By 2020, that could create up to 1.8 million jobs and boost annual GDP by up to $320 billion. The impact could grow to $600 billion annually by 2030 if the selection, delivery, and operation of infrastructure investments improve. </h3></span>
    <li><span class="mck_h3_sm"><h3>A more effective US system of talent development.</span> The nation&rsquo;s long-standing advantage in education and skills has been eroding, but today real improvements are within reach. At the postsecondary level, expanding industry-specific training and increasing the number of graduates in the fields of science, technology, engineering, and math could build a more competitive workforce. At the K&ndash;12 level, enhancing classroom instruction, turning around underperforming high schools, and introducing digital learning tools can boost student achievement. These initiatives could raise GDP by as much as $265 billion by 2020&mdash;and achieve a dramatic &ldquo;liftoff&rdquo; effect by 2030, adding as much as $1.7 trillion to annual GDP. </h3></span>
</ul>
<p>These opportunities can have immediate demand-stimulus effects that would get the economy moving again in the short term and also have longer-term effects that would build US competitiveness and productivity well beyond 2020. Taking action now could mark a turning point for the US economy and drive growth and prosperity for decades to come. </p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>General Motors and its</strong> Chinese joint-venture partners sold more cars in 2010 in China (2.35 million units) than in the United States (around 2.2 million units). In an edited version of an interview with McKinsey&rsquo;s Glenn Leibowitz and Erik Roth, <a href="http://www.mckinsey.com/~/#Wale">GM China president Kevin Wale explains</a> the importance of team-based innovation efforts in China and describes GM&rsquo;s rapidly growing Advanced Technical Center in Shanghai. He also observes that innovation in China&rsquo;s auto industry is more about commercialization models than technical achievements.</p>
<p>While automotive innovation has had years to take hold, innovation on the leading edge of the semiconductor business remains nascent. But barriers that once held back local chip makers now appear to be eroding. This means global players will face some tough trade-offs in the years ahead. The challenge: how to participate in China&rsquo;s growth&mdash;which may well require joint ventures with domestic players&mdash;without sacrificing valuable intellectual property. <a href="http://www.mckinsey.com/~/#Dvorak">McKinsey&rsquo;s Bob Dvorak, Sri Kaza, and Nick Santhanam describe</a> this dilemma and present a few ideas for multinational companies trying to overcome it.</p>
<!--roadblock-->
<p>Finally, <a href="http://www.mckinsey.com/~/#Yang">Steve Yang, head of R&amp;D for Asia and emerging markets for the global drugmaker AstraZeneca, articulates</a> some key differences between pharma development in China and Western markets. The starting point: different disease prevalence (gastric and liver cancer, for example, are more prevalent in China). In an edited version of an interview with McKinsey&rsquo;s Jeremy Teo, Yang describes new models of innovation that could emerge from China, as well as the long-term commitment to talent development that will be needed for AstraZeneca&rsquo;s Chinese research center to reach its innovative potential.</p>

<div style="height: 24px; clear: both;"></div>
<h3>Innovation through commercialization</h3>
<p>There&rsquo;s probably more innovation in going to market and in thinking about new business opportunities than there is in technical innovation. Technical innovation is lagging behind the rest of the world in maturity. The country is trying to get there as quickly as it can but doesn&rsquo;t have the deep graduate research capability that the rest of the world has.</p>
<p>What China does better than any place else in the world is to innovate by commercialization, as opposed to constant research and perfecting the theory, like the West. When the Chinese get an idea, they test it in the marketplace. They&rsquo;re happy to do three to four rounds of commercialization to get an idea right, whereas in the West companies spend the same amount of time on research, testing, and validation before trying to take products to market. The electric vehicle is a good example. The Chinese view is that it&rsquo;s not going to be perfect, and they&rsquo;re not trying to make it perfect from day one. They&rsquo;ve got a few more series of improvements to go, and they&rsquo;ll work on them in parallel with finding out what the customer really likes and adapting to that. That&rsquo;s an innovative way of doing innovation, something that the rest of the world is struggling to understand. In our business in China, if we don&rsquo;t innovate through or with commercialization, we&rsquo;re going to lag behind our competitors.</p>
<h3>The power of teamwork</h3>
<p>We&rsquo;re trying to set up a small unit that is designed to focus on what some people call &ldquo;innovation,&rdquo; but what I call &ldquo;predator versus prey.&rdquo; Everyone&rsquo;s coming after us, and we want to stay the predator. The only way to do that is by having people who are focused on who is doing what to us and where the opportunities are.</p>
<p>We find the deployment of small task teams is by far the best approach to drive these innovative ideas. Take OnStar,<a href="http://www.mckinsey.com/~/#" class="link-footnote" onclick="return false;" rel="#footnote1"><sup>1</sup></a> <span class="tooltip" id="footnote1" style="display: none;"><span class="footnote-content"><span class="footnote-number">1.</span><span class="footnote-text"> OnStar, a subsidiary of GM, is a vehicle safety, security, and information service system. </span><span class="clear"></span></span><span class="footnote-bottom"></span></span>for instance, which was actually quite innovative for this market. The way we did it was well ahead of others. These systems are released by code, and they&rsquo;re now up to OnStar 8. We deployed the absolute latest and went straight to 8; we didn&rsquo;t start at 1. It was a calculated risk that we could make a business model that could benefit from this technology and cover the significant cost and technical support required to support that. Being out there, it feels like you&rsquo;re in the Wild West. Four to five of you are in a team. You don&rsquo;t have a lot support, but a lot of responsibility.</p>
<p>In our joint ventures, we&rsquo;re happy to take innovation from suppliers any day of the week. We encourage suppliers to come up with new ideas. We have a lot of local technology in our cars. Our people wanted to lead and they worked with suppliers to develop new ways of doing things. Lighting systems and infotainment are pretty much at the cutting edge of what&rsquo;s available.</p>
<h3>R&amp;D and advanced design centers in China</h3>
<p>We wanted to take advantage of some of the great talent that&rsquo;s going to be coming out of the universities. They&rsquo;re going to be coming out in droves. They&rsquo;re not at the advanced graduate stage, simply because they don&rsquo;t have the mentors in the system, but they will be coming out, and there&rsquo;s plenty of good talent now that we can staff.</p>
<p>We also want to do research and applied development that is close to the biggest market in the world. It really is very easy to ignore the realities of life when you don&rsquo;t confront them every day. So we want to make sure that we have activity in the market, with people who speak the language, understand the culture, and confront that culture every day. The first building that&rsquo;s going up is a battery lab. With the electric vehicle, there will be a lot of suppliers, a lot of government support; the rules will be different, and the applications will be different. We want to be here, where we will be learning that every day and reacting to it every day. It&rsquo;s the same research capability we have in Detroit, but we&rsquo;re able to do the work here and frame it around real local knowledge.</p>
<p>We also will have an advanced design center here for the same reason. It&rsquo;s hard to imagine doing advanced design without taking into account the influence of the largest and fastest-growing market in the world. So we&rsquo;re putting in a starting point where we will have the basis for future creativity in the country.</p>
<p>The leader of our R&amp;D is a local Chinese who has worked in R&amp;D in China and has excellent connections with the local universities. We also have excellent connections with universities, and we run multiple projects through a program called &ldquo;PACE&rdquo;<a href="http://www.mckinsey.com/~/#" class="link-footnote" onclick="return false;" rel="#footnote2"><sup>2</sup></a> <span class="tooltip" id="footnote2" style="display: none;"><span class="footnote-content"><span class="footnote-number">2.</span><span class="footnote-text"> Partners for the Advancement of Collaborative Engineering Education. </span><span class="clear"></span></span><span class="footnote-bottom"></span></span>and through cooperative development. That will be the starting ground for recruiting.</p>
<p>Also, we&rsquo;re offering more internships than we normally do because we want to take the best young technical talent. Initially, we will supplement them with skilled researchers from the rest of the world, primarily the United States. But at the end of the day, we will use local skilled talent. We don&rsquo;t see a problem for the size of what we&rsquo;re doing here. It&rsquo;s a big site, but it&rsquo;s not a big number of people at a particular time&mdash;probably 300 people to start with&mdash;among all those areas: design, advanced research, powertrain engineering.</p>
<h3>Integration with global product development</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;d say with a fair degree of confidence that we integrate our Chinese operations fully into our global operations better than anyone else in the world. If we&rsquo;re working on a global program, we&rsquo;ll be doing serious work down the road the same way as they&rsquo;re doing it in the United States or Germany.</p>
<p>Our engineering centers two years ago introduced the subcompact Chevrolet Sail, which was completely designed here. The low-cost passenger vehicle was difficult to provide out of a global solution because we were trying to cater to too many global needs. That opened the opportunity for the Sail. We were able to focus on addressing a solution that wasn&rsquo;t going to come out of a global package.</p>
<p>The latest Buick GL8 minivan was introduced here and was done pretty quickly through capability that is built here in China, using a combination of on-the-job mentoring, coaching, and expert assistance from overseas, as well as a very structured development process from our global team. The GL8 is an old GM architecture that no one else wanted, but it&rsquo;s a terrific product for China. It has turned into an unbelievably good-looking and highly desirable car. I can&rsquo;t tell you how many senior executives and CEOs ring me up trying to speed up their provision of the GL8.</p>
<p>The Baojun brand is a lower-priced sedan aimed at consumers who live outside of China&rsquo;s major markets. It&rsquo;s just a massive opportunity in China, and the ability to meet the income needs and transportation needs of that group of people was never going to be met by GM in a traditional sense.</p>

<div style="height: 24px; clear: both;"></div>
<p>The semiconductor industry is a powerful example of the tension surrounding China&rsquo;s potential for innovation. The country&rsquo;s leaders understand the important role silicon plays in product innovation, so for two decades they have sought to create a more potent domestic semiconductor industry&mdash;with mixed results. China purchases 33 percent of the world&rsquo;s chips ($100 billion worth), using them both in products sold domestically and in exports. But most of the Chinese industry competes in commoditized areas such as chip assembly and testing, and Chinese semiconductor companies hold 4 percent or less of the most prized segments of the global value chain in chip design and manufacturing.</p>
<p>This article highlights four obstacles that have kept the country in check, the potential for their impact to diminish, and the resulting challenge for global producers that have been reluctant to share key elements of intellectual property (IP) with Chinese players.</p>
<h3>Shifting winds</h3>
<p>Structural changes in the industry and the marketplace, coupled with new industrial policies that promote next-generation technologies and technology transfers from abroad, are combining to weaken the barriers that have held China back.</p>
<h3 class="sm black">Chips designed for China&rsquo;s needs</h3>
<p>Chinese players have exerted little influence on semiconductor design, technology standards, or chip selection for major product categories such as mobile phones, laptop computers, and LCD televisions. Most decisions about design and functionality come from global champions and reflect the preferences of consumers in Europe, Japan, and the United States.</p>
<p>But that dynamic is shifting, along with the rising economic power of China&rsquo;s middle class, with its increasingly diverse needs. Some Chinese companies are now moving to the forefront of a &ldquo;built in China, for China&rdquo; movement. Their clout is likely to mean that more semiconductor platforms will be designed locally. Consider the fact that in 2010, Chinese consumers purchased 19 percent of all PCs sold throughout the world, 18 percent of the LCD TVs, 14 percent of the mobile phones, and 26 percent of the automobiles (all by unit volume).</p>
<p>China&rsquo;s manufacturers, meanwhile, are leveraging this domestic scale to sell in global markets: Lenovo now ranks second in global PC sales and ZTE fourth in the manufacture of handsets. Huawei ranks among the top three world players in all segments of telecom equipment.</p>
<h3 class="sm black">Export controls lose their bite</h3>
<p>The home governments of leading semiconductor manufacturers have long banned the sale of leading-edge manufacturing technology to China. Current controls by Taiwan and the United States, for example, bar the export of equipment used to make chips below the 65-nanometer threshold.<a href="http://www.mckinsey.com/~/#" class="link-footnote" onclick="return false;" rel="#footnote4"><sup>4</sup></a> <span class="tooltip" id="footnote4" style="display: none;"><span class="footnote-content"><span class="footnote-number">4.</span><span class="footnote-text"> A designation of the size of semiconductor processing units or nodes. Lower numbers represent greater processing power, with more modes per chip. Controls generally apply to the two most recent generations of semiconductors. </span><span class="clear"></span></span><span class="footnote-bottom"></span></span>As a result, Chinese manufacturers are at least two generations behind the highest-performing 32-nanometer chips.</p>
<p>Market changes, however, are eroding the impact of these bans. Leading-edge semiconductors represent only 14 percent of global demand&mdash;half the market share of 2003&mdash;as fewer devices require the highest levels of processing power.<a href="http://www.mckinsey.com/~/#" class="link-footnote" onclick="return false;" rel="#footnote5"><sup>5</sup></a> <span class="tooltip" id="footnote5" style="display: none;"><span class="footnote-content"><span class="footnote-number">5.</span><span class="footnote-text"> At the same time, semiconductor manufacture is reaching the limits of Moore&rsquo;s law, which predicts that the performance of semiconductors will rise rapidly while costs decrease. This phenomenon has allowed China to catch up in trailing-edge technologies. </span><span class="clear"></span></span><span class="footnote-bottom"></span></span>That&rsquo;s particularly true of devices favored by China&rsquo;s new consumers, whose purchases often involve entry-level mobile phones and TVs. The result: a more level playing field for China&rsquo;s players, some of which can now use manufacturing processes that are two generations behind to mass-produce chips that represent sizable markets (for example, analog integrated circuits and microcontrollers).</p>
<h3 class="sm black">Reordering China&rsquo;s high-tech zones</h3>
<p>China&rsquo;s industrial planners made missteps in early efforts to incubate a semiconductor industry. Rather than concentrate investments and incentives in one geographic area, as the Taiwanese did with Hsinchu Science Park, government officials dispersed their bets, financing fabrication sites in 19 cities. This fragmentation hindered the establishment of a vibrant semiconductor ecosystem with clusters of manufacturing prowess and design talent.</p>
<p>China has corrected its course, however, and now is concentrating more investment in a smaller number of cities&mdash;for instance, Chengdu, Dalian, and Shanghai. These centers have a stronger base of expertise, as well as a critical mass of manufacturers and suppliers. They are attracting investment from global leaders and developing more broadly based value chains in areas such as wireless communications systems.</p>
<h3 class="sm black">A new regime for technology transfer</h3>
<p>Foreign players own most of the IP across the semiconductor value chain, and the lion&rsquo;s share of revenue streams for the design of semiconductors and the processes used to manufacture them goes to non-Chinese companies. While the Chinese have found ways to acquire or piece together IP to build a strong position in many industries, the challenge in semiconductors is uniquely difficult because of the complexity of chip design and manufacturing and the high level of materials science that is required.</p>
<p>China, however, has one of world&rsquo;s best-funded and ambitious tech industry policies, and acquiring semiconductor know-how and IP remains a high priority. Increasing China&rsquo;s chances for success is a new, two-pronged initiative that will increase the pressure on global companies to share their IP with Chinese partners. The first part involves stepped-up investments and new policy directives that will advance large, next-generation technology platforms such as cloud computing, the Internet of Things,<a href="#" class="link-footnote" onclick="return false;" rel="#footnote6"><sup>6</sup></a> <span class="tooltip" id="footnote6" style="display: none;"><span class="footnote-content"><span class="footnote-number">6.</span><span class="footnote-text"> For more, see Michael Chui, Markus L&ouml;ffler, and Roger Roberts, &ldquo;<a href="http://www.mckinseyquarterly.com/article_page.aspx?ar=2538">The Internet of Things</a>,&rdquo; <em>McKinsey Quarterly</em>, 2010 Number 2. </span><span class="clear"></span></span><span class="footnote-bottom"></span></span>and hybrid electric vehicles. These three markets represent tens of billions of dollars in opportunities for global and domestic semiconductor companies. The second part sets targets for indigenous innovation, with the goal of reducing dependence on foreign technologies to 30 percent, from the current 50 percent. Government purchases of products and services, from mobile phones to cloud-computing networks, will favor products that incorporate high levels of domestically developed technology.</p>
<h3>Strategic choices for global players</h3>
<p>For global semiconductor players, the dilemma is clear: how to participate in what will probably be the world&rsquo;s most dynamic technology growth environment while safeguarding core IP and know-how. These companies must remember that China seeks to use transferred IP and manufacturing methods to create its own champions that can compete with global countries around the world, not just in the local market.</p>
<p>The experience of high-speed rail players provides a cautionary tale. Global companies were encouraged to form partnerships with Chinese ones to develop a national high-speed network. Some foreign companies favored a relatively restrictive sharing of IP, but a classic prisoner&rsquo;s dilemma<a href="http://www.mckinsey.com/~/#" class="link-footnote" onclick="return false;" rel="#footnote7"><sup>7</sup></a> <span class="tooltip" id="footnote7" style="display: none;"><span class="footnote-content"><span class="footnote-number">7.</span><span class="footnote-text"> The prisoner&rsquo;s dilemma, a situation analyzed in game theory, shows why two individuals may fail to cooperate, despite the fact that cooperation would seem to be advantageous for both. </span><span class="clear"></span></span><span class="footnote-bottom"></span></span>scenario played out: the attractiveness of market access gave global players a powerful incentive to ditch hard-line positions. In the end, industry partnerships were formed on less restrictive terms. Within three years, Chinese companies had absorbed key elements of the core technology, and since 2007 they have won nearly $20 billion in new rail contracts.</p>
<p>Global semiconductor players thus will need to be clear about the terms of engagement with potential partners. China&rsquo;s complex fabric of national, provincial, and local policy makers and companies creates a considerable opportunity for customized strategies. Forming ventures with strictly delineated IP transfer terms is the obvious solution. Global leaders such as GE (in rural health care) and ABB (in electric motors and power transmission) are exploring alternatives.</p>
<p>One option is for foreign companies to launch indigenous R&amp;D centers with Chinese universities and institutes and to focus these facilities on developing technologies for unproven but promising next-generation domestic markets. Multinationals that participate in such ventures align themselves with China&rsquo;s goals while they contain IP risks to markets that are still evolving. Another approach is to focus on local product development in partnership with downstream players such as auto manufacturers. This strategy helps multinationals meet local-technology requirements and provides for more active risk management.</p>

<h3>What&rsquo;s different about China</h3>
<p>There are many unique disease mechanisms in China. Gastric and liver cancers, for example, have high prevalence and, in many cases, could have different populations or different disease etiologies. That presents a white space on which R&amp;D innovation can focus. We can use what we have learned in the West to understand this situation and to try to develop new medicines against those diseases. I hope that will open up new markets and help us meet unmet medical needs of patients in China and the rest of Asia.</p>
<p>Also very important is that China and, to some extent, India have shown the world the importance of conducting R&amp;D with more resource efficiency, particularly by focusing on externalization. This could mean strategic outsourcing of certain R&amp;D functions. It could also mean collaborating with academics or biotech companies, and that&rsquo;s an area in which I believe China can offer tremendous potential not only for our local R&amp;D operation but also for our global R&amp;D.</p>
<p>Finally, there&rsquo;s China&rsquo;s urbanization. There are consequences to the migration to megacities with populations of more than 20 million. In these environments, people will increasingly have a more sedentary lifestyle. In such an environment, with high-density living, how do we continue to help people live a healthy lifestyle, prevent disease, and improve the quality of living? And the challenges and opportunities go beyond just inventing the next pill or vial for injection, to fundamentally thinking about what, with so many people living together, the best way is to prevent disease or at least slow down disease and some of the chronic disease progressions. That is something I don&rsquo;t think the world has really tackled before. The scale of such innovation is where China can offer ground for experimentation.</p>
<h3>Progress to date</h3>
<p>We have made great progress and built a solid foundation. Our Innovation Center China was announced in 2006 as part of a $100 million investment we made in China, and it was launched in October 2007. During the four years since then, we have accumulated a lot of data, contributed to global oncology research in the area of biomarkers and translational science, and built credibility and a strong team locally. We are ready to expand our mission to become a drug discovery center, with a special focus on cancers prevalent in Asia, such as gastric and liver cancers.</p>
<p>But the journey has just started. If you use as a measure the time needed to develop a new drug, we still have a long way to go. It takes 10 to 15 years to take an idea all the way from a scientist&rsquo;s hypothesis to products on the market. There is a Chinese saying that you may have a destiny, and that final destiny may be very bright, but the road that leads there is inevitably windy and full of challenges. That&rsquo;s the case at both the strategic and operational levels. On a day-to-day basis, managing turnover and retaining and developing talent can be challenging, although in AstraZeneca R&amp;D we are fortunate to have a turnover rate well below the industry average. Also, AstraZeneca is a multinational company, and the majority of our senior leaders, our resources, and our stakeholders are thousands of miles and many time zones away. Constantly gathering their support and commitment is very important.</p>
<p>Finally, we have seen a significant improvement in the IP environment. But, because of the rapid development of the legislative environment and the regulatory framework, there is a constant flow of amendments to policies on the IP law. In many cases, it took some time for the government, the legislature, and enforcement agencies, as well as industry, to understand fully what those new regulations meant. That&rsquo;s just natural growing pains. In IP law, there has been a recent commitment reflecting the government&rsquo;s increasing understanding of the importance of IP, but we hope to have more clarity around how those new laws will be interpreted and enforced.</p>
<h3>The talent situation</h3>
<p>There are a large number of scientists available, trained either overseas or locally. We have seen significant quality of talent both in the returnee population and in the locally educated population. There are disciplines&mdash;for example, chemistry and general biology&mdash;that tend to follow this trend. There are also disciplines that are highly specialized and require decades of training. In those areas, the talent, particularly those with experience, is in short supply. Examples would be toxicologists, pathologists, statisticians, and clinicians. That&rsquo;s one dimension to look at: the technical competency of the talent.</p>
<p>The other dimension, given the fast growth of the markets, includes the leadership and management capabilities of the talent. In many cases, companies like ours need to ramp up our efforts quickly, so we are giving the scientists&mdash;particularly the scientific leaders&mdash;the mandate not only to do good science and to drive projects but also to become good leaders and good managers. If we use those criteria, the number of individuals who possess all these skills is smaller.</p>
<p>But in general, we are optimistic. From our own experience, we can recruit talent overseas and locally. And to support our portfolio, our mission, and, more important, the Innovation Center China, we have an excellent record in retaining and continuously developing those colleagues.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Most large consumer-facing</strong> companies realize that they will need China to power their growth in the next decade. But to keep pace, these companies will also need to understand the economic, societal, and demographic changes shaping the profiles of consumers and the way they spend. This is no easy task not only because of the fast pace of growth and subsequent changes in the Chinese way of life but also because of the vast economic and demographic differences across the country. </p><p>
These differences are set to become more marked, with significant implications for companies that fail to grasp them. Since 2005, McKinsey has conducted annual consumer surveys in China, interviewing a total of more than 60,000 people in upward of 60 cities.<a class='link-footnote' rel='#footnote1' href='#' onclick='return false;'><sup>1</sup></a> <span id='footnote1' class='tooltip' style='display:none;'><span class='footnote-content'><span class='footnote-number'>1.</span><span class='footnote-text'>
The latest survey, carried out in 2011, gauged Chinese consumers’ attitudes and spending behavior for about 60 product types and 300 brands. The respondents—representing a wide range of incomes, ages, regions, and cities—accounted for 74 percent of China’s total GDP and 47 percent of the total population. 
</span><span class='clear'></span> </span><span class='footnote-bottom'></span></span> Our surveys have tracked the growth of incomes, shifting patterns of expenditure, rising expectations—sometimes in line with those of the respondents’ Western counterparts and sometimes not—and the development of many different consumer segments. Those surveys now provide insights to help us focus on the future. We cannot, of course, predict it with certainty, and external shocks might confound any forecast. But our understanding of consumer trends to date, coupled with an analysis of the economic and demographic factors that will further shape them in the next decade, serve as a useful lens for contemplating the profile of the Chinese consumer in 2020.</p><!--roadblock--><h3>Changing demographics</h3><p>
Many of the changes taking place in China are common features of rapid industrialization: rising incomes, urban living, better education, postponed life stages, and greater mobility. Japan saw similar changes in the 1950s and 1960s, as did South Korea and Taiwan in the 1980s. </p><p>
But some unique factors are also at work, such as the government’s one-child policy and the marked economic imbalances among regions. Our analysis reveals important insights into the likely demographic and socio-demographic profiles of Chinese consumers at the end of this decade.<a class='link-footnote' rel='#footnote2' href='#' onclick='return false;'><sup>2</sup></a> <span id='footnote2' class='tooltip' style='display:none;'><span class='footnote-content'><span class='footnote-number'>2.</span><span class='footnote-text'>
We focus on urban consumers in this report.
</span><span class='clear'></span> </span><span class='footnote-bottom'></span></span></p><p>
Changes in economic profiles have been and will continue to be the most important trend shaping the consumer landscape. The Chinese are certainly getting richer fast: the per-household disposable income<a class='link-footnote' rel='#footnote3' href='#' onclick='return false;'><sup>3</sup></a> <span id='footnote3' class='tooltip' style='display:none;'><span class='footnote-content'><span class='footnote-number'>3.</span><span class='footnote-text'>
Urban-household disposable income—the combined disposable income of all members of a household—is defined as total household income minus income taxes and contributions to social security.
</span><span class='clear'></span> </span><span class='footnote-bottom'></span></span> of urban consumers will double between 2010 and 2020, from about $4,000 to about $8,000.<a class='link-footnote' rel='#footnote4' href='#' onclick='return false;'><sup>4</sup></a> <span id='footnote4' class='tooltip' style='display:none;'><span class='footnote-content'><span class='footnote-number'>4.</span><span class='footnote-text'>
 In 2010 real terms for all dollar and renminbi figures in this article, unless stated otherwise.
</span><span class='clear'></span> </span><span class='footnote-bottom'></span></span> That will be close to South Korea’s current standard of living but still a long way from its level in some developed countries, such as the United States (about $35,000) and Japan (about $26,000). </p><p>
The current vast differences in income levels will persist, however, although the numbers at each level will shift dramatically (Exhibit 1). At present, the great majority of the population consists of “value” consumers—those living in households with annual disposable incomes between $6,000 and $16,000 (equivalent to 37,000 to 106,000 renminbi), just enough to cover basic needs. “Mainstream” consumers, relatively well-to-do households with annual disposable income of between $16,000 and $34,000 (equivalent to 106,000 to 229,000 renminbi), form a very small group by comparison. China has fewer than 14 million such households, representing only 6 percent of the urban population. A tiny group of “affluent” consumers, whose household income exceeds $34,000, accounts for only 2 percent of the urban population, or 4.26 million households.</p>

    <p>
Until now, these divergences have presented multinational companies operating in China with a choice: to target only mainstream and affluent consumers or to stretch the brand to serve the value segment. Those that took the first course could more or less maintain the same business model they applied in other parts of the world, without needing to de-engineer their products. But in taking that approach, they limited themselves to a target market of 18 million households. Companies that chose to serve the value category benefitted from a much bigger market to play in—184 million households—but their products had to be cheaper, they were forced to adapt their business models, and profitability was lower. </p><p>
This situation is changing. Because the wealth of so many consumers is rising so rapidly, many people in the value category will have joined the mainstream one by 2020. Indeed, mainstream consumers will then account for 51 percent of the urban population. Their absolute level of wealth will remain quite low compared with that of consumers in developed countries. Yet this group, comprising 167 million households (close to 400 million people), will become the standard setters for consumption, capable of affording family cars and small luxury items. Companies will be able to respond by introducing better products to a vast group of new consumers, thus differentiating themselves from competitors and earning higher profits. Nevertheless, value consumers, whose ranks will fall to 36 percent of urban households in 2020, from 82 percent in 2010, will still represent an enormous market for cheaper products: 116 million households, or 307 million consumers.</p><p>
Affluent consumers will remain an elite minority, making up only 6 percent of the population in 2020. (In the United States in 2010, more than half of the population earned at least $34,000.) But that 6 percent will translate into about 21 million affluent households, with 60 million consumers.</p><p>
While income is expected to rise across China, some cities and regions are already significantly wealthier than others. Understanding these variations in the rate of development is important because they will affect which categories of goods and services grow most rapidly, and where.</p><p>
Today, about 85 percent of mainstream consumers live in the 100 wealthiest cities; in the next 300 wealthiest, only 10 percent of consumers are mainstream, but that percentage will rise to nearly 30 percent by 2020. At that point, many families in these cities will be able to afford a range of goods and services (such as flat-screen televisions and overseas travel) that are now largely confined to the wealthiest urban areas. Exhibit 2 explains the distribution of income in four different groups of cities. Some of them (Foshan in Guangdong, for example) are small in terms of absolute GDP or population size. But it’s worth noting that the affluence of their populations could make them as attractive to companies as leading tier-one cities, such as Shanghai and Shenzhen. </p> 
    <div id="v3">
      <h4>Exhibit 2</h4>
      
      <p>The change in income distribution will vary across cities and may suggest new markets.</p>

    <h3>New spending patterns</h3><p>
An understanding of China’s changing economics and its impact on the profiles of consumers helps to identify some key trends in spending patterns in the next decade. We discuss three: high growth in discretionary categories, the tendency to trade up as consumers spend some of their discretionary income on better goods and services, and the emergence of a senior market.</p><h3 class="sm black">Higher discretionary spending</h3><p>
Bigger incomes and government efforts to increase consumption will benefit all consumer-facing companies, though to varying degrees, depending on their product portfolios. Discretionary categories will show the strongest overall growth—13.4 percent—between 2010 and 2020, as these goods become affordable to growing numbers of consumers. Next come semi-necessities (10.9 percent growth) followed by necessities (7.2 percent). These average figures will of course vary significantly by region and city.</p><p>
Exhibit 3 shows forecast annual consumption by category for 2020 and the rising importance of discretionary spending. Each broad category includes subcategories, some of which are more discretionary than others and expected to grow faster. For example, a discretionary category within food—dining out—is expected to grow by 10.2 percent a year in the coming decade, against 7.2 percent growth for basic food ingredients.</p> 
    <div id="v3">
      <h4>Exhibit 3</h4>
      
      <p>Discretionary spending is expected to grow considerably by 2020.</p>
      <div>
        <a href="http://www.mckinsey.com/tools/Wrappers/Wrapper.aspx?sid={E2D88CD9-B2B5-465A-A3D8-38574D8A3659}&amp;pid={7F4DBFBC-A2D2-4D4F-A86E-C3457F737A06}">
          <img src="http://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/McKinsey/dotcom/Insights/Asia-Pacific/Meet the Chinese consumer of 2020/svgz_Web_ChinaConsumer_ex3.ashx">
        </a>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>
Of course, the wealthiest people—those in our affluent segment—will be the main consumers of discretionary items. Less obvious is the <i>extent</i> to which they will be able to afford more such items in 2020, compared with people in other income groups, as their numbers and wealth grow. Our consumption model suggests that in 2010, average household spending for value, mainstream, and affluent consumers was about $2,000, $4,000, and $12,000, respectively. These figures will jump to $3,000, $6,000, and $21,000, respectively, by 2020. So although all consumers will increase their spending, the gaps between different income groups will widen significantly. Stark disparities in standards of living are emerging in China. </p><h3 class="sm black">Aspirational trading up</h3><p>
The second noticeable trend in spending is a propensity to trade up, driven increasingly by consumers aspiring to improve themselves, the way they live, and their perceived social standing. Many Chinese, like their Western counterparts, judge themselves and others by what they buy.</p><p>
Strong early growth in developing markets comes when large numbers of consumers try products for the first time. As markets mature, growth relies on consumers who buy more goods and services more frequently and trade up to buy pricier versions of items they already have. This pattern explains why some basic-necessity categories have little room for growth: many consumers can already afford such items and probably won’t buy a great deal more of them. But that does not mean no growth at all. Take the market for sauces and condiments. Most people can already afford to buy as much as they need of these items. But the increased attention now paid to health and well-being shows that even here, companies have trading-up opportunities. </p><p>
Such opportunities also exist within semi-necessity categories, such as apparel, health care, and household products: more consumers will be able to afford different outfits for different occasions, for instance, or to buy additional branded products. As a consequence, brands focused on mass-market consumers might need to be repositioned to suit their rising aspirations, while newer, younger brands may be able to leapfrog more established competitors by offering premium products and crafting a premium brand image.</p><p>
But it is the top end of the market that will benefit most from trading up: growth at the high end of some consumer goods categories already outpaces average growth for those categories as a whole. Sales of premium skin care products, for instance, rose by more than 20 percent a year in the past decade while the industry average was 10 percent.</p><p>
Annual volume growth rates of more than 20 percent are foreseeable for luxury SUV cars, compared with around 10 percent for basic family models. China had already become a leading luxury market by 2010 and could overtake Japan to become the biggest such market by 2015.</p><h3 class="sm black">Emerging senior market</h3><p>
The aging of China means that as a share of the total population, it will have five percentage points more people above the age of 65 in 2020 than it has today. That is an extra 126.5 million citizens, clearly an important consumer segment. What is equally important is the way the spending patterns of older people in 2020 will differ from those of older people now. In our 2011 survey, the elderly were more inclined to save and less willing to spend on discretionary items such as travel, leisure, and nice clothes. These tendencies will probably be much less apparent in 2020.</p><p>
Most people in China over the age of 55 experienced the harsh conditions of the Cultural Revolution, in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Not surprisingly, they think it important not to spend frivolously. Among residents of tier-one cities, 55- to 65-year-olds allocate half of their spending to food and little to discretionary categories: only 7 percent goes toward apparel, for example. People who are ten years younger devote only 38 percent of their spending to food but 13 percent to apparel. Indeed, our consumer surveys have revealed that although today’s older consumers behave very differently from younger ones, today’s 45- to 54-year-olds—the older generation come 2020—have spending patterns similar to those of 34- to 45-year-olds (who allocate 34 percent of their spending to food and 14 percent to apparel). This finding implies that companies will have to rethink their ideas about what older Chinese consumers want.</p><h3>Implications for companies</h3><p>
The biggest challenge is building and sustaining a leading position in China and, for multinationals, using it to drive global growth. In fact, as the country with the world’s largest group of mainstream consumers, it could be an excellent test bed for companies that serve this consumer segment. Our analysis indicates that huge variations in the growth rates of companies operating in China come 2020 are likely, depending on the product category, consumer segment, and geography.</p><p>
A second challenge is that China is so vast and its regions so diverse it should be treated almost as a collection of separate countries. Companies should redefine the roles of their regional divisions and headquarters, delegating more decision-making power to the former. Many companies already operate with three, five, or even more regional bases, but these tend to function only as sales offices, executing instructions from the top. Consumer needs could become so varied across China’s regions that local insight and strategic decision-making power will be vital. Regional offices should therefore receive full responsibility for their own profit-and-loss accounts, strategic planning, consumer research, innovations, portfolios, route-to-market models, and marketing. The corporate center should have a redefined role—serving the individual units and safeguarding the company’s brands—with less power and at a lower overhead cost.</p><p>
A third challenge stems from the fact that undifferentiated mass consumption and the rising cost of ads made the scale of a brand or product crucial to its success in the past decade. Companies provided the same value proposition—usually framed around a product’s functional benefits—to all types of consumers, while stretching brands across product categories and price tiers to leverage scale and garner market share. Over the next decade, the game will change to take account of the emergence of different categories of consumers and their own sense of their differences and individuality. Companies will need the crispest value propositions to connect with each group and to stand out from competitors. By 2020, they will have to position brands (or sub-brands) to target narrower consumer segments and offer more tailored value propositions. Brands extended across too many consumer segments and price points may struggle to defend their market position. Hard though the transition could be, at some point companies that have focused on maximizing their brands’ scale will have to adopt a model based on a portfolio of more targeted brands or sub-brands to connect with different consumer segments.</p><p>
No doubt China and its consumers’ behavior will take some unexpected turns over the next decade. Nonetheless, our research reveals the clear direction of travel. To be sure of taking part in that journey, companies in the market should start making the acquaintance of China’s 2020 consumers today.<br /></p><p><i>Read</i> <a href="http://www.mckinseychina.com/2012/03/07/meet-the-2020-chinese-consumer" target="_blank">Meet the 2020 Chinese consumer</a>, <i>the full report on which this article is based, on the McKinsey Greater China Web site.</i></p><div class="about-authors"><h3 class="sm black">About the authors</h3><p><b>Yuval Atsmon</b> is a principal in McKinsey’s Shanghai office, and <b>Max Magni</b> is a principal in the Hong Kong office.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>China&rsquo;s financial-services industry</strong> has grown quite rapidly over the past decade&mdash;product offerings, talent pools, and sales channels are increasing in scale and quality across sectors. With so many new opportunities available, companies raced to capture market share in many segments and products. Today, the industry&rsquo;s prospects in China remain attractive, and much more alluring than they are almost anywhere else. However, financial-services firms there now face a decade of transformation in which they must adapt to structural shifts ranging from new customer demands to the market&rsquo;s maturation. To win in changing times, these firms must refocus on profits and customer service.</p>
<p>To provide guidance on the evolving Chinese landscape, McKinsey&rsquo;s financial-services practice is releasing a series of reports that discuss major trends and strategic priorities. <!--roadblock-->The first three reports discuss the following sectors: </p>
<ul class="leftContentUL">
    <li>
    <p><strong>Retail banking.</strong> China&rsquo;s retail-banking market holds great potential for the future&mdash;in fact, it is poised to become the world&rsquo;s second largest by 2015. Recognizing the opportunity, Chinese retail banks have concentrated over the past decade on increasing scale rather than profitability. But as <em><a href="http://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/sitecore/service/notfound.aspx.ashx">Next-generation retail banking in China: Building eight transformational capabilities</a></em> (PDF&ndash;915KB) argues, this business model isn&rsquo;t sustainable. Banks are now under more pressure to increase returns on assets and customer satisfaction. In some segments, such as the credit-card market in major cities, penetration has reached the point where substantial growth is no longer attainable solely by acquiring new customers. Retail banks won&rsquo;t win in this market unless they shift emphasis to improving profit per customer. That change will force them to focus on three objectives: building better primary relationships with customers, creating smarter and more focused acquisition strategies, and developing low-cost and scalable operating models.</p>
    </li>
</ul>

    <div id="v3">
      <h4>Exhibit</h4>
      
      <p>China will become the second-largest retail-banking market in the world by 2015, with an annual revenue pool of around $280 billion by 2020.</p>
      <div>
        <a href="http://www.mckinsey.com/tools/Wrappers/Wrapper.aspx?sid={1DCBDC47-DC45-42A6-A695-D34B382AE5EF}&amp;pid={A84EC035-2BAD-416D-9A64-7A15D6ED42BE}">
          <img src="">
        </a>
      </div>
    </div>
    
<ul class="leftContentUL">
    <li>
    <p><strong>Securities markets.</strong> After several near-death experiences two years ago, leading securities firms strengthened their capital ratios and adjusted their business and economic models to restore profitability. There is still much room for improvement, however, as <em><a href="http://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/008092D00CCE446EBF2EE5C997D1FB28.ashx">The next decade of innovation and transformation in China&rsquo;s securities industry</a></em> (PDF&ndash;916KB) demonstrates. Most firms still provide their retail and institutional customers with a limited range of commoditized services focused on cash execution. Their business models help them perform well during boom markets but are inadequate during downturns. In the future, winning firms will provide broader, more differentiated offerings to remain relevant&mdash;for example, personal advisory services for high-net-worth individuals, prime-brokerage products, or deep market insights for institutional investors. </p>
    </li>
    <li>
    <p><strong>Life insurance.</strong> Although China&rsquo;s life-insurance market slowed in 2012, significant gains could materialize in the future given the emergence of the country&rsquo;s middle class, rapid urbanization, and an aging population. <em><a href="http://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/C59B94751A8F41FFBDF136DFC3E46C32.ashx">Growth under uncertainty: Trends, issues, and outlook of China&rsquo;s life insurance industry</a></em> (PDF&ndash;8,520KB) describes how companies can capture new opportunities by undertaking a holistic transformation touching every aspect of their business. In addition to revitalizing traditional sales channels (agents and bancassurance), companies must expand their product mix and create more offerings that focus on the core value proposition of life insurance: guaranteeing income for survivors. Finally, they must put more emphasis on customer needs throughout the entire product life cycle&mdash;marketing, packaging, distribution, and product design.</p>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>Across all three sectors, the challenges that lie ahead may seem daunting. But as the financial sector continues its transformation in a more mature and complex market, one thing is certain: firms will be at a disadvantage if they don&rsquo;t make difficult decisions about their strategies and business models now.<a href="http://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/AA8A7CAD5BD343AD904CBC735EB2FBA5.ashx">Winning strategies for US asset managers</a></p>]]></content:encoded>

<p><strong>McKinsey:</strong> How is the role of IT changing at Coca-Cola, and, with it, your role as CIO?</p>
<p><strong>Ed Steinike:</strong> IT and marketing are very close partners at Coca-Cola today&mdash;more so, I think, than at most other companies&mdash;and that&rsquo;s the way it should be. Coke is spending hundreds of millions of dollars a year on digital marketing, and that number will, no doubt, continue to rise. Almost all of that spending is IT-related. This development calls for a broader CIO role. It&rsquo;s not enough to be an operational back-office CIO running the systems. It&rsquo;s also not enough to be a process CIO reinventing the supply chain and transforming support functions. Important as those two roles are, they need to be complemented by what I call the revenue-generator CIO or business-level CIO.</p>
<!--roadblock-->
<p><strong>McKinsey:</strong> What were the beginnings of the strategic partnership between marketing and IT at Coca-Cola?</p>
<p><strong>Ed Steinike:</strong> Our marketers started to think more seriously about digital channels five years ago or so. As mobile adoption expanded, they started to build a direct connection with our customers by pushing mobile applications for social-media sites and our loyalty programs, such as My Coke Rewards.</p>
<p>
Marketing was driving a lot of it through its own advertising and digital agencies while IT, at the time, was struggling to be relevant. We were viewed as a back-office function, not as one of the strategic leaders and partners in our digital-marketing efforts. I believed we should be bringing ideas to marketing instead of marketing coming to us for creative solutions and more often than not getting the answer, &ldquo;Sorry. We don&rsquo;t have the people to do these things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>
Our first step was simply to offer traditional operating, hosting, and security for the sites and platforms the agencies were building. We did that quite well and now have over 600 consumer sites hosted in one platform environment with great data protection.</p>
<p><strong>McKinsey:</strong> What did it take to get to the level of business partner, to get to the point, for example, where you were coming up with cool mobile apps and connecting them with consumer-relationship programs?</p>
<p><strong>Ed Steinike:</strong> It&rsquo;s all about people. Just like Coca-Cola&rsquo;s marketing organization, which hired some really smart people in the field of digital and interactive marketing, we started to recruit talented IT people who were more entrepreneurial, a little more strategic in their thinking, and who connected better with what marketing was trying to achieve. As one example, my enterprise architect is based in Silicon Valley with his team&mdash;closer to where the solutions are likely to come from.</p>
<p>
That said, we still have some way to go when it comes to getting young people with a different kind of mind-set. We used to bring in 35 IT interns each year, but we hired none of them despite the great work they did, because our focus was on seasoned hires, for example, business and systems analysts and project managers. We certainly must have experienced people for big systems applications and the like, but for application-development work using software as a service, an entry-level hire may be just fine.</p>
<p>
We&rsquo;re now hiring five of our interns each year, and it&rsquo;s amazing what they can do. They look at the world differently, and they come up with new answers. They help us build a new culture in which IT is a better business partner. It will take years to complete this cultural shift, but it will only happen if we address the people side of it.</p>
<p><strong>McKinsey:</strong> What is the IT department doing today to cultivate direct consumer relationships?</p>
<p><strong>Ed Steinike:</strong> Recently, for the 2012 Summer Olympics, we created mobile applications tailored for over 100 countries and available in the Android and iPhone stores, in order to create a digital-marketing event around the globe that boosted our impact well beyond our traditional sponsorship and television advertising channels. The IT department built some of the applications and managed others created by external agencies or our consumers. When content comes from thousands and thousands of sources, it requires a complete ecosystem. We&rsquo;re now running content-management systems, digital-rights-management systems, digital-access-management systems, and mobile-distribution systems. Packaging content and distributing it around the world is a very big area for us right now. Today, digital marketing is a joint activity in our company, with marketing in many cases looking directly to us for better ways to reach our customers.</p>
<p><strong>McKinsey:</strong> Having demand-driven supply-chain systems is a trend in consumer packaged goods. What is Coca-Cola doing in this field?</p>
<p><strong>Ed Steinike:</strong> It&rsquo;s a very important area for Coca-Cola. We&rsquo;ve been working hard the last couple of years to integrate our plant and distribution systems to make it possible for us to see exactly what&rsquo;s happening with our products as they move through the supply chain. One critical benefit is to ensure that we can minimize out-of-stocks. Imagine that we direct our Facebook fans to a local outlet with a targeted promotion and the product isn&rsquo;t available. We&rsquo;ve lost a sale and had a negative impact on relationships with our consumers. The inventory at the back of a store is pretty visible, but we lose track at the shelf point and the cooler point. We&rsquo;re experimenting with some interesting methods to fill that gap, such as radio-frequency identification and electronic tagging of our products.</p>
<p>
Interestingly, we have a pretty cool solution to this in the United Kingdom, where we have merchandisers take pictures of our shelves and coolers when they come into stores to talk about orders, promotions, and so on. We spent a lot of time trying to automate the processing of information found in the photographs, but it turned out that a better solution was to send the photos to a company in India: its staff studies the shots and in less than a minute gets back to us with stock counts of each product. It&rsquo;s a nice blend of technology and human process. Is there a better solution? We&rsquo;re still experimenting.</p>
<p><strong>McKinsey:</strong> What is the best example of IT&rsquo;s new role at Coca-Cola?</p>
<p><strong>Ed Steinike:</strong> Coca-Cola Freestyle, our revolutionary fountain dispenser, integrates most of what the IT department is up to and also points the way toward a technology-driven future for beverages that might be quite different from the present landscape. Earlier fountains were basically mechanical machines. Coca-Cola Freestyle is effectively a complex and sensitive enterprise-resource-planning environment. A computer embedded in the new fountain machine calculates with surgical precision the ingredients of over 100 different beverage brands. To begin, consumers experiment a bit with various brands until they find one they really like. When they do, we find that they come back to our fountains for that particular drink and this leads to increased same-store sales.</p>
<p>
The computer records all the data involved in every single pour. Each fountain knows when it&rsquo;s running low on certain products. We are also using automated ordering in many Coca-Cola Freestyle locations whereby the fountain can build its own orders for supplies and place them directly into the system. It would even optimize the order so that you pay the lowest possible delivered cost. There are other things we can do with the operational data, such as working with the owner of the fountain location to talk about, for example, what drinks are moving at certain times of the day and, as a result, potential opportunities to adjust pricing and promotions. Broader marketing data represent another area. Is there, for example, a particular drink that happens to be selling really well in a particular region, country, or city?</p>
<p>
We have visions of how we will use the data as we deploy thousands and thousands of the machines in locations such as restaurant chains, entertainment venues, and retail stores. We&rsquo;ve got 50 million&ndash;plus fans on Facebook. We&rsquo;ve got some 18 million people on My Coke Rewards. If we could bring these audiences together around Coca-Cola Freestyle, we could learn some really cool things.</p>
<p><strong>McKinsey:</strong> A final question, what&rsquo;s your advice to a CIO starting out in the consumer-packaged-goods industry?</p>
<p><strong>Ed Steinike:</strong> My advice is that there&rsquo;s an interesting shift going on in the world of consumer packaged goods, and IT has to stay very close to the new trends if it wants to be relevant. If you&rsquo;re comfortable being an operational CIO you&rsquo;ll still be needed, but I don&rsquo;t think you&rsquo;re going to help your company grow as fast as it could.</p>

      <description>It’s time to use a structured process for selecting the nonexecutive leader of the board. Defining the role is a good start.</description>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Ever since stock-listing requirements</strong> prompted many US companies to name an independent director to serve as the chairman, lead director, or presiding director of the board, these companies have been grappling with what, exactly, this board leader should do and how to find the right person for the job.</p>
<p>The change in governance followed corporate scandals (in the early part of the decade) that led to investor pressures to strengthen corporate governance by separating the roles of CEO and chairman. This separation represented a step into the unknown, because the CEO traditionally served as chairman in most US companies and was the board&rsquo;s undisputed leader. The combined role of CEO and chairman is still very common, but the governance structure at most Fortune 100 companies<a href="#" class="link-footnote" onclick="return false;" rel="#footnote1"><sup>1</sup></a> <span style="display: none;" id="footnote1" class="tooltip"><span class="footnote-content"><span class="footnote-number">1.</span><span class="footnote-text"> According to <i>Agenda</i>&rsquo;s 2009 board leadership guide, of the 96 Fortune 100 public companies included in the research, 43.8 percent had a presiding director and 37.5 percent a lead director. The most common governance structure in the largest US companies combined the positions of chairman and CEO and complemented this with a presiding director. For more, see <a href="http://agendaweek.com" target="_blank">agendaweek.com</a>. </span><span class="clear"></span></span><span class="footnote-bottom"></span></span>has now been complemented by a presiding or lead director, who plays a substantial role in leading the board&rsquo;s work.</p>
<p>To examine how the new board leader role has evolved, and the best practices for appointing one, we invited 11 current and former board leaders of large US companies to share their views and experiences (see sidebar, &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s who&rdquo;). One of their insights was that there is little difference in how their companies utilize the board leader whether the organization refers to that person as a presiding or lead director or as a nonexecutive chairman, although a few interviewees saw the latter title as having more importance symbolically. These board leaders spoke of a role that has grown beyond mandated process requirements, to carry a more substantive meaning for the creation of corporate value. At many leading companies today, the board leader is a real partner of the CEO on strategy issues and has taken over or partnered with the CEO on some functions the chief executive has historically led, such as setting board agendas, recruiting new directors, and more aggressively assessing risk.</p>

<p>Our panel also noted how the process of selecting a board leader has been evolving from an unstructured and haphazard approach toward one that should ideally resemble the best practices for CEO succession. The board leaders we interviewed agreed, without exception, that good board succession planning starts with producing a formal document that specifies the duties and the personal characteristics the board leader should have, even though they may change over time. This document could also be used for evaluating the board leader from time to time.</p>
<p>Based on our interviews and experience of serving on corporate boards, we believe that the leader&rsquo;s duties should ideally include chairing executive sessions, board meetings in the absence of the chairman (when the CEO has that role too), and meetings of the independent directors when necessary, as well as presiding over the board evaluation process to ensure that the board functions effectively. The duties should also involve frequent cooperation with the CEO in communicating with shareholders and external stakeholders, working with board committee chairmen (for example, on the CEO&rsquo;s evaluation and compensation), and acting as a liaison between the board and management. What&rsquo;s more, the board leader should ensure that a succession plan is in place for the CEO and the board leader, as well as work in partnership with the CEO on strategy issues.</p>
<p>Every one of the interviewees emphasized the need for close collaboration and trusted communication with the CEO and fellow directors to help the board navigate the challenges of a complex business environment and to focus boardroom discussions on strategy and overall value creation. Some interviewees discussed the need for the board leader to facilitate the evaluation of the board&rsquo;s performance and, if needed, to deal with problem directors. Most interviewees believed that &ldquo;firing a director&rdquo; should be a process led by the board leader, based on peer- and/or self-assessments.</p>
<p>Given the focus on meetings and conversations, many directors in our panel stressed that the board leader must be a superb facilitator. &ldquo;A skilled board leader can wring a lot out of these discussions,&rdquo; said Jim Cullen, the lead director of Johnson &amp; Johnson and nonexecutive chairman of Agilent Technologies. And this function &ldquo;lies at the heart of what a board leader can bring to the governance process and to the successful strategic momentum of the business.&rdquo; Doing one&rsquo;s homework on the business is also key. &ldquo;You have to stay current [and] understand the priorities of the business, the strategy, and the direction of the business, especially if you are going to have candid one-on-one discussions with the CEO,&rdquo; Cullen said.</p>
<p>When Jack Krol became the lead director at Tyco International, in 2003, he developed, in conjunction with CEO Edward Breen, a document specifying his own role. With input from the board, the governance committee then developed some general characteristics of the role for whoever would succeed Krol in the future. Krol said three competencies or characteristics were deemed most critical.</p>
<p>First, Krol said, &ldquo;the ideal candidate has to have stature with the other directors and be seen as a leader in the boardroom.&rdquo; Krol also noted that &ldquo;the ideal board leader is an engaged and thoughtful director. This candidate adds value during board deliberations, with significant comments when compared to others who may talk more but, over time, indicate a lack of substance&rdquo;&mdash;adding that &ldquo;you just know it when you see it.&rdquo; Second, &ldquo;the candidate must have compatibility with the CEO as well as good chemistry, and the person should not be adversarial.&rdquo; Third, &ldquo;the candidate must express interest and have the time to do the job.&rdquo; Krol added, &ldquo;at Tyco I was involved nearly every day for a year during the crisis, either at a company location or on the phone.&rdquo; (Krol was referring to Tyco&rsquo;s 2002 financial woes, which were compounded by accounting scandals involving its former CEO L. Dennis Kozlowski.) Indeed, many of the directors we interviewed underlined that boards should select leaders with the assumption that at some stage during their tenure, the company would be under some form of stress or in a crisis.</p>
<p>Advance planning and a well-vetted description of the role were essential when Krol recently handed over the reins as lead director to fellow Tyco International director Bruce Gordon. Krol, now nonexecutive chairman of Delphi, knew the stakes were high. If he and Tyco International&rsquo;s board hadn&rsquo;t found a successor capable of carrying on the dynamic created by the board and CEO Edward Breen, that failure might have unraveled years of progress in transforming the company&rsquo;s governance in the eyes of shareholders and employees alike. The process was conducted over several months. The governance committee developed a list of three Tyco directors who best met the selection criteria and then conducted discussions, led by Krol, with each candidate and the CEO. Ultimately, an executive session of the board made the selection, based on the committee&rsquo;s recommendation. The process, not unlike one that should be used to evaluate inside candidates for the job of CEO, enabled the board to engage in a thoughtful, well-paced process to arrive at the right answer.</p>
<p>The smooth succession at Tyco exemplifies best rather than common practice. Few of the companies in our sample had a formal specification for the board leader position when the time came to pass the baton, but all believed that such a specification should be created for the next &ldquo;baton pass.&rdquo; We find there is an increasing number of companies whose board leader says his or her board intends to develop a better profile of the ideal leader and then goes after the right candidate based on the formal specification rather than requiring candidates to compete with only nebulous criteria as their guide.</p>
<p>The old method of picking a successor wouldn&rsquo;t stand up in today&rsquo;s governance environment, noted Harold A. (&ldquo;Hap&rdquo;) Wagner, who was lead director at United Technologies for five years. Wagner recalls that when it was time for him to step down, in 2008, there was no document specifying the criteria for the selection of his successor. &ldquo;Today, the position of lead director has been much more magnified,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I suspect that there is a specification now for lead director at UTC, and, if not, there should be.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="articleBreak"></div>
<p>The board leader role has come a long way and is still evolving. What works best for one company may not necessarily fit another, because of varying degrees of business success, different cultures, and unique personal chemistry on the board. However, the common themes and recommendations uncovered by our research might help to shape the outlook of all boards when the time comes to pick a new board leader. </p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>It is often said</strong> that the principles of great leadership are timeless, or based on immutable truths. But when we meet with the men and women who run the world&rsquo;s largest organizations, what we hear with increasing frequency is how different everything feels from just a decade ago. Leaders tell us they are operating in a bewildering new environment in which little is certain, the tempo is quicker, and the dynamics are more complex. They worry that it is impossible for chief executives to stay on top of all the things they need to know to do their job. Some admit they feel overwhelmed.</p>
<p>To understand the leadership challenge of our volatile, globalized, hyperconnected age more clearly, we recently initiated a series of structured interviews with the leaders of some of the world&rsquo;s largest and most vibrant organizations. Excerpts from six of those conversations appear below. The leaders&mdash;Josef Ackermann, formerly of Deutsche Bank; Carlos Ghosn of Nissan and Renault; Moya Greene of Royal Mail Group; Ellen Kullman of DuPont; President Shimon Peres of Israel; and Daniel Vasella of Novartis (see sidebar, &ldquo;Leaders on leadership&rdquo;)&mdash;represent a diverse array of viewpoints. All are grappling with today&rsquo;s environment in different ways. But the common themes that emerged from these conversations&mdash;what it means to lead in an age of upheaval, to master personal challenges, to be in the limelight continually, to make decisions under extreme uncertainty&mdash;offer a useful starting point for understanding today&rsquo;s leadership landscape.</p>

<p>After presenting the ideas of these leaders on leadership, we offer a few additional reflections on the topic. They draw in part on the interviews, as well as on our experiences with clients; on conversations with dozens of experts in academia, government, and the private sector; and on our review of the extensive academic and popular literature on the subject. All reinforce our belief that today&rsquo;s leaders face extraordinary new challenges and must learn to think differently about their role and how to fulfill it. Those who do may have an opportunity to change the world in ways their predecessors never imagined.</p>
<br />
<!--roadblock-->
<h3>Leading in an age of upheaval</h3>
<p><em>A convergence of forces is reshaping the global economy: emerging regions, such as Africa, Brazil, China, and India, have overtaken economies in the West as engines of global growth; the pace of innovation is increasing exponentially; new technologies have created new industries, disrupted old ones, and spawned communication networks of astonishing speed; and global emergencies seem to erupt at ever-shorter intervals. Any one of these developments would have profound implications for organizations and the people who lead them. Taken together, these forces are creating a new context for leadership.</em></p>
<p><strong>Josef Ackermann:</strong> We experienced a tremendous shift in the global balance of power, which manifests itself in our business. In the 1980s, over 80 percent of Deutsche Bank revenues were generated in Germany. In the mid-1990s, they still accounted for about 70 percent. Today, Germany, despite its continuing economic strength, stands for 38 percent of global revenues. Over the years, people in our headquarters, in Frankfurt, started complaining to me, &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t see you much around here anymore.&rdquo; Well, there was a reason why: growth has moved elsewhere&mdash;to Asia, Latin America, the Middle East&mdash;and this of course had consequences on the time spent in each region.</p>
<p>Managing risk also has become much more complex for banks. It&rsquo;s not only market risk; there is more and more political and social risk. Increasingly, financial markets are becoming political markets. That requires different skills&mdash;skills not all of us have acquired at university; how to properly deal with society, for example, a stakeholder that has immensely grown in importance since the financial crisis.</p>
<p><strong>Carlos Ghosn:</strong> I don&rsquo;t think leadership shows unless it is highlighted by some kind of crisis. There are two kinds. There are internal crises that arise because a company has not been managed well. Then there are external crises, like the collapse of Lehman Brothers or the earthquake in Japan or the flood in Thailand. In that case, you are managing your company, and all of a sudden there is this thing falling on you.</p>
<p>Business schools may prepare people to deal with internal crises. But I think we need to be more prepared for external crises, where it&rsquo;s not the strategy of the company that is in question; it&rsquo;s the ability of leaders to figure out how to <em>adapt</em> that strategy.</p>
<p>We are going to have a lot more of these external crises because we are living in such a volatile world&mdash;an age where everything is leveraged and technology moves so fast. You can be rocked by something that originated completely outside your area.</p>
<p>I think one of the reasons Nissan has been able to cope with external crises better than some of our competitors is that we have a more diverse, multinational culture. We don&rsquo;t just sit around waiting for the solution to come from headquarters. We are accustomed to always looking around, trying to find out who has the best ideas. Our people in the US talk to our people in Japan on an equal level. We have a lot more reference points.</p>
<p><strong>Ellen Kullman:</strong> These days, there are things that just come shooting across the bow&mdash;economic volatility and the impact of natural events like the Japanese earthquake and tsunami&mdash;at much greater frequency than we&rsquo;ve ever seen. You have to be able to react very quickly. And the world is so connected that the feedback loops are more intense. You&rsquo;ve got population growth and the world passing seven billion people last year, and the stresses that causes, whether it&rsquo;s feeding the world, creating enough energy, or protecting the environment. We matched our focus, our research and development, and our capital expenditures up against megatrends like these over the last five years. This is the future, so we need to understand how our science relates to it.</p>
<p><strong>Shimon Peres:</strong> The last two decades have witnessed the greatest revolution since Genesis. States have lost their importance and strength. The old theories&mdash;from Adam Smith to Karl Marx&mdash;have lost their value because they are based on things like land, labor, and wealth. All of that has been replaced by science. Ideas are now more important than materials. And ideas are unpredictable. Science knows no customs, no borders. It doesn&rsquo;t depend on distances or stop at a given point.</p>
<p>Science creates a world where individuals can play the role of the collective. Two boys create Google. One boy creates Facebook. Another individual creates Apple. These gentlemen changed the world without political parties or armies or fortunes. No one anticipated this. And they themselves did not know what would happen as a result of their thoughts. So we are all surprised. It is a new world. You may have the strongest army&mdash;but it cannot conquer ideas, it cannot conquer knowledge.</p>
<br />
<h3>Mastering today&rsquo;s personal challenges</h3>
<p><em>The rigors of leadership have prompted many leaders to think of themselves as being in training, much like a professional athlete: continually striving to manage their energy and fortify their character. There is a growing recognition of the connection between physical health, emotional health, and judgment&mdash;and of how important it can be to have precise routines for diet, sleep, exercise, and staying centered.</em><a href="#" class="link-footnote" onclick="return false;" rel="#footnote1"><sup>1</sup></a> <span class="tooltip" id="footnote1" style="display: none;"><span class="footnote-content"><span class="footnote-number">1.</span><span class="footnote-text">For more on centered leadership, see Joanna Barsh, Josephine Mogelof, and Caroline Webb, &ldquo;<a href="http://www.mckinseyquarterly.com/article_page.aspx?ar=2678">How centered leaders achieve extraordinary results</a>,&rdquo; <em>McKinsey Quarterly</em>, 2010 Number 4.</span><span class="clear"></span></span><span class="footnote-bottom"></span></span></p>
<p><strong>Moya Greene:</strong> The first criterion is: do you love it? It&rsquo;s a seven-day-a-week job. I think that&rsquo;s true for anyone in these roles. If you don&rsquo;t love the company and the people&mdash;<em>really</em> love them&mdash; you can&rsquo;t do a job like this.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m pretty energetic. I start at five in the morning. I don&rsquo;t even think about it anymore; the alarm goes off and I&rsquo;m up. I go for a 30-minute run. I do weight training three mornings a week. I try to eat well, but not too much. I&rsquo;m a big walker&mdash;that&rsquo;s my favorite thing. I try to get a good walk every weekend. I go on walking vacations.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve usually got three or four books on the go. I&rsquo;ve given up on novels. I can&rsquo;t get through them no matter how good they are; there&rsquo;s no way I&rsquo;ll finish before there&rsquo;s some kind of interruption. So I read poetry now: the collected works of Ted Hughes, Emily Dickinson. I&rsquo;m working my way through Philip Larkin. You can take a Larkin poem and read it on the bus in 15 minutes. The good ones stay with you and will come back to you. That&rsquo;s what I like about poetry: you get a little shot of mental protein without a lot of time.</p>
<p><strong>Josef Ackermann:</strong> Just to give you an idea of my calendar for the next ten days: Berlin tomorrow, then Seoul, then Munich, then Frankfurt, then Singapore, then the Middle East. I&rsquo;m almost constantly on a plane. With all this traveling, physical stamina has become much more important.</p>
<p>I remember a time when after flying to Hong Kong you could take a whole day off to recover. Today, right after landing you rush to your first meeting. And maybe you already have a conference call in the car on your way into town. You are lucky if you get enough time to take a shower.</p>
<p>And of course, with all the new information technology, you are constantly available, and the flow of information you have to manage is huge; that has added to the pressure. You are much more exposed to unforeseen shifts and negative surprises and you have to make quick decisions and respond to or anticipate market movements around the world. So you have to have a very stable psyche as well. I see more and more people these days who just burn out.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a tech freak. I use my iPhone and send text messages, that&rsquo;s it. I still like to have paper in front of me and I do a lot in written-memo form. I think people who constantly use their BlackBerry or iPhone easily lose sight of the big picture.</p>
<p>It also helps me enormously that I can sleep anywhere, whether I am in a car or an airplane. If you&rsquo;re unable to relax quickly, I think you can&rsquo;t be a CEO for a considerable length of time. Some people do meditation or yoga. I don&rsquo;t do any such thing. I think you have it in your DNA or you don&rsquo;t.</p>
<p><strong>Dan Vasella:</strong> I talk to my team about the seductions that come with taking on a leadership role. There are many different forms: sexual seduction, money, praise. You need to be aware of how you can be seduced in order to be able to resist and keep your integrity.</p>
<p>Every CEO needs someone who can listen&mdash;a board member, an adviser&mdash;someone to whom he can speak in total confidence, to whom he can say, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had it; I&rsquo;m about to resign.&rdquo; Or, &ldquo;I really want to beat this guy up.&rdquo; You need someone who understands and can help you to find the balance. Leaders often forget the importance of stable emotional relationships&mdash;especially outside the company. It helps tremendously to manage stress. Your partner will do a lot to help keep you in sync.</p>
<p>You have to be able to switch on and switch off. Are you entirely present when you&rsquo;re present? Can you be entirely away when you&rsquo;re away? The expectation is that your job is 24/7. But no one can be the boss 24/7. You need to have a moment when you say, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m home now,&rdquo; and work is gone.</p>
<p><strong>Carlos Ghosn:</strong> Leading takes a lot of stamina. I became CEO at 45. But I was working like a beast. You think, &ldquo;So I work 15, 16 hours a day; who cares?&rdquo; But you can&rsquo;t do that when you are 60 or 65.</p>
<p>And now companies are more global. So you have jet lag, you are tired, the food is different. You have to be very disciplined about schedules and about organizing everything. Physical discipline is crucial, for food, exercise, sleep. I live like a monk&mdash;well, maybe not a monk, but a Knight Templar. I wake at a certain hour, sleep at a certain hour. There are certain things I won&rsquo;t do past a certain time.</p>
<p><strong>Ellen Kullman:</strong> I spend a lot more time on communication, more time out at plant sites, in sales offices, with customers, in our research laboratories. I&rsquo;m bringing my board of directors to India in a couple of weeks to help them really see the issues we&rsquo;re facing. That&rsquo;s where I get my energy from. It&rsquo;s contagious. I come away from these engagements with ideas, energy, and a real sense of focus on where we as a company need to go. That&rsquo;s part of what drives me.</p>
<p><strong>Shimon Peres:</strong> The mind of a leader must be free&mdash;a mind that can dream and imagine. All new things were born in dreams. A leader must have the courage to be a nonconformist, just like a scientist. He must dream, even if he dreams alone or if people laugh at him. He must not let his heart falter.</p>
<p>Today, the separation between generations is stronger than between nations. Our children say, &ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t impose upon us your own arrogance&mdash;the world you created, wounded by war, corrupted by money, separated by hatred. And don&rsquo;t try to build artificial walls between us and other youngsters.&rdquo; Because they were born in a new age. For them, the modern equipment of communication is what paper and pen are for us. They can communicate much more easily and don&rsquo;t feel all this hidden discrimination that we were born with and find so difficult to get rid of.</p>
<h3>The (now 24/7) public face of leadership</h3>
<p><em>Nearly everyone we spoke with commented on the challenge of dealing with constant scrutiny and of acting as a connector in a complex ecosystem. As the face of the organization, leaders must be prepared to address the immediate, practical concerns of the job while also maintaining and articulating a long-term vision of the organization&rsquo;s purpose and role in society&mdash;all against a backdrop of 24-hour financial coverage, ubiquitous blogs, and Twitter feeds. That means learning new modes of communicating across today&rsquo;s far-flung networks and working harder to craft clear, simple messages that resonate across cultures.</em></p>
<p><strong>Josef Ackermann:</strong> CEOs have become highly public figures. And media scrutiny has become very personal. Particularly in our home market, Germany, it&rsquo;s always, &ldquo;Ackermann says this&rdquo; or &ldquo;Ackermann&rsquo;s doing that&rdquo;&mdash;even if I personally had nothing to do with it. You are the institution you lead.</p>
<p>After I became CEO, the former head of the Bundesbank one day took me aside and gave me some valuable advice: &ldquo;From now on, you must remember that you are two people. You are the person whom you and your friends know, but you are also a symbol for something. Never confuse the two. Don&rsquo;t take criticism of the symbol as criticism of the person.&rdquo; That advice has helped me a lot.</p>
<p><strong>Dan Vasella:</strong> People have a legitimate demand for access to the CEO. But you have to modulate that so you avoid overexposure. You&rsquo;re a product. And the press will paint you as either a hero or a villain&mdash;whatever sells. If they paint you as a hero today, you should be prepared to be painted as a villain tomorrow. Not everything you do will work out every time, and you have to accept that people will be unfair.</p>
<p><strong>Moya Greene:</strong> A decade ago, I&rsquo;d have said that it was harder to be a public official than an executive in the private sector. But the tables have turned. It&rsquo;s tough these days to be the CEO of any business&mdash;even a very successful one with a balanced view of the corporation&rsquo;s position in society.</p>
<p>My public-sector experience has helped me to understand how easily sound policies can be derailed by small, symbolic things. It may not matter that the policy change you are advocating is the product of fantastic analytics or years of brilliant stakeholder management; the tiniest little spark can become a flash fire&mdash;something that takes hold and transforms perceptions in ways that don&rsquo;t seem rational. If you work in the public sector, you learn the value of developing antennae for popular perceptions and keeping them finely tuned.</p>
<p>I spend about 15 percent of my time trying to help our own people understand how good we are at what we do, which isn&rsquo;t always easy, because there is so much negativism in the press. I see good internal communications as a way to punch through and get our message out, to tell our people&mdash;who are the most powerful ambassadors for our brand&mdash;&ldquo;Stand up and be proud.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Carlos Ghosn:</strong> In business, there are no more heroes. The media has become a lot more negative about corporate leaders over the past ten years. Small mistakes get blown up into huge things.</p>
<p>I cannot imagine myself today doing what I did in Japan in 1999, when I stood up and said: &ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to get rid of the seniority system. We&rsquo;re going to shut down plants. We&rsquo;re going to reduce headcount. We&rsquo;re going to undo the keiretsu system.&rdquo; I had a lot of criticism. But there were also people who said, &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s give him the benefit of the doubt.&rdquo; Today, if I were to stand up and try to do something like that, I would get massacred. I would need much more emotional stability and certainty. Leaders of tomorrow are going to have to be incredibly secure and sure of themselves.</p>
<p>Leaders of the future will also need to have a lot more empathy and sensitivity&mdash;not just for people from their own countries but for people from completely different countries and cultures. They are going to need global empathy, which is a lot more difficult.</p>
<p><strong>Shimon Peres:</strong> Words are the connection between leaders and the public. They must be credible and clear and reflect a vision, not just a position. The three greatest leaders of the 20th century were Winston Churchill, Charles de Gaulle, and David Ben-Gurion. Each had a brilliant mind and a brilliant pen. Their ability with a pen demonstrated many things: curiosity, memory, courage. They understood that you lead not with bayonets but with words. A leader&rsquo;s words must be precise and totally committed.</p>
<br />
<h3>Decision making under uncertainty</h3>
<p><em>A final theme is that leaders must increasingly resist the temptation to cope with chaos and complexity by trusting their gut. At a time of extreme volatility, past experience is an unreliable guide to future outcomes. Leaders must create cultures of constructive skepticism and surround themselves with people who bring multiple perspectives and have no fear of challenging the boss.</em></p>
<p><strong>Carlos Ghosn:</strong> It is a paradox: on the one hand, you have to be more confident and secure, but on the other, you have to be a lot more open and empathetic. You need to listen, but then when you make a decision, that&rsquo;s it&mdash;you must be a very hard driver. Usually, these are not attributes you find in the same person.</p>
<p>Once you have done the analysis and made the decision, then you have to learn to simplify the decision in communicating it to others. Everything&rsquo;s complex, but once you have decided, sometimes you need to simplify so much it&rsquo;s almost a caricature. You must say, &ldquo;Nothing matters beyond this.&rdquo; You must reduce everything to zeros or ones, black or white, go or no-go. You can&rsquo;t have too much nuance.</p>
<p>In a crisis, you have to be able to do all of these things&mdash;listening, deciding, and then simplifying&mdash;very quickly. That is what makes leading in a crisis so interesting. And because you have to move so fast, you have to empower people to make decisions themselves. That&rsquo;s the best way to restore calm.</p>
<p><strong>Moya Greene:</strong> When I came here, we were running out of cash. I was grappling with decisions that would determine whether or not we could stay in business. But you cannot position your company in the broader social and economic fabric of the nation if all you do is look at the financial dimensions of performance. You have to look at what your customers think, what your employees think, and what you can do for your customers.</p>
<p><strong>Daniel Vasella:</strong> As a leader, to whom can you express your doubts&mdash;and should you? In which situation is it appropriate and when not? I believe that you have to be able to express doubt in your team and with a board. If you don&rsquo;t&mdash;and you pretend&mdash;then you are playing a role, which eventually leads to an unhealthy situation. That&rsquo;s not to say you should act like you&rsquo;re in a confessional. At some point [in decision making], you have to take the sword and cut through the Gordian knot and make a decision, despite any uncertainties.</p>
<p>But the question is: are you being led by the context or do you lead? Are you being led by your followers and are they choosing for you? Or do you choose and do you lead? I think you have to be aware of the context, and what people expect and hope for. But as a leader, you&rsquo;re not there to feed people with all the things they hope for. Your job is to persuade people to do the things you believe will be the right direction for the long term. People want you to lead. And if you lead, you will hurt. You will satisfy sometimes. You will celebrate and you will blame. That&rsquo;s all part of your job.</p>
<p><strong>Josef Ackermann:</strong> Problems have become so complex today that you have to collect the expertise and opinions of a lot of people before you can make a sound decision. Some people say, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t decide until you have to.&rdquo; I have a completely different view. I hate to be under time pressure. I think it is important that you aren&rsquo;t confronted with a situation where you haven&rsquo;t heard anything on a particular issue for half a year&mdash;and then suddenly you have to make a quick decision on the basis of an executive summary.</p>
<p>I believe in personal leadership, but no CEO can do it all on his own. You need the expertise, judgment, and buy-in of your team.</p>

<h3>Preparing for a new era of leadership</h3>
<p>It&rsquo;s never been realistic to break leadership into a fixed set of essential competences, and that&rsquo;s particularly the case in today&rsquo;s complex, volatile environment. Still, the themes our interviewees sounded represent a rich set of opportunities for leaders to boost their effectiveness. To close, we&rsquo;d like to amplify and extend those themes by emphasizing three skills that can help leaders thrive in today&rsquo;s turbulent environment, which for many has prompted a reexamination of fundamental assumptions about how they do their jobs, while underscoring the importance of leading with a purpose. Resilient leaders, as Shimon Peres reminded us, are those who have &ldquo;ambition for a cause greater than themselves.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>1. See with a microscope and a telescope</h3>
<p>Over the next two decades, McKinsey research suggests, the conditions of the late 20th century&mdash;cheap capital, low interest rates, a global demographic dividend, and a gradual decline in commodity prices&mdash;will either be reversed or seesaw violently. Managing the immediacy of these changes, while also staying alert for the inflection points that signal bigger, long-term &ldquo;trend breaks,&rdquo; will require leaders to see the world in multiple ways at once.</p>
<p>In different ways, many leaders have told us they&rsquo;ve needed to develop a facility for viewing the world through two lenses: a telescope, to consider opportunities far into the future, and a microscope, to scrutinize challenges of the moment at intense magnification. Most of us are naturally more comfortable with one lens or the other; we are &ldquo;farsighted&rdquo; or &ldquo;nearsighted,&rdquo; but rarely both. In times of complexity, leaders must be able to see clearly through either lens and to manage the shift between the two with speed and ease.</p>
<p>Leaders must use the telescope to watch for long-term trends, dream big dreams, imagine where a company should be in five or ten years, and reallocate resources accordingly. The accelerating pace of technological innovation makes this aspect of a leader&rsquo;s role more important than ever. The microscope, too, affords a critical perspective. Leaders must force their organizations to challenge conventional wisdom; consider the implications of unlikely, &ldquo;long-tail&rdquo; scenarios; and focus on pressing issues in minute detail. As organizations grow larger and more complex, leaders must work harder to stay in touch with the front line and view themselves as &ldquo;chief reality testers.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>2. Compete as a tri-sector athlete</h3>
<p>Many of the forces buffeting leaders in the private sector&mdash;slow growth, unemployment, sovereign indebtedness&mdash;can be addressed only in concert with the public sector and are heavily influenced by the actions of groups that are neither commercial nor governmental entities. When governments play an ever more active role in regulating markets, and social movements can spring up in a matter of days, corporate leaders must be nimble &ldquo;tri-sector athletes,&rdquo; to borrow a phrase from Harvard political scientist Joseph Nye: able to engage and collaborate across the private, public, and social sectors. Leaders of governments and nongovernmental organizations must likewise break out of their silos. Issues such as infrastructure, unemployment, education, or protecting the environment are too complex and interrelated to deal with in isolation. Many of the leaders with whom we spoke said they have learned the value of examining their business decisions in a social and political context. Even those wary of open-ended discussions about corporate social responsibility say they find it useful to think about managing a &ldquo;triple bottom line&rdquo; that reflects their organizations&rsquo; performance in the public, private, and social spheres.</p>
<h3>3. Stay grounded during a crisis </h3>
<p>Everyone we interviewed agreed that modern leaders spend far more of their time firefighting than their predecessors did. Coping with externally generated crises, many argued, has become a key part of the modern leader&rsquo;s role. In an age when crisis is the new normal, global organizations need leaders who are able to act quickly and calmly amid chaos. Many leaders highlighted the value of &ldquo;stress-testing&rdquo; members of the top team to gauge their ability to cope with crisis. We heard again and again that otherwise competent managers can&rsquo;t always perform in moments of extraordinary pressure. The chief executive of one of the world&rsquo;s largest companies marveled at how, in the face of a cash flow crisis following the collapse of Lehman Brothers, two of his top reports &ldquo;shattered like glass.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The emotional and physical stamina demanded of leaders today is extraordinary. Many of those we interviewed reserve crucial decisions for moments when they know they will be rested and free from distraction. They also talked about sequencing decisions to focus on key issues first, not after they have been depleted by lesser matters. We are intrigued by the growing body of research in psychology, sociology, and neuroscience that highlights the importance of &ldquo;decision fatigue.&rdquo; The implication of this research is that trying to make too many decisions at once diminishes the ability to make wise decisions at all.</p>

<p>If the burden of leadership in the modern age seems overwhelming, the potential benefits are overwhelming too. Large organizations&mdash; if led well&mdash;can do more for more people than they have at any other moment in history. That is the flip side of all the chaos, complexity, and pressure, and it makes leading through those challenges a noble endeavor.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>It&rsquo;s been a while</strong> since the world has been truly preoccupied with the threat of sustained high oil prices. The global economic recovery has been muted, and a double-dip recession remains possible.</p>
<p>But that dour prospect shouldn&rsquo;t make executives sanguine about the risk of another oil shock. Emerging markets are still in the midst of a historic transition toward greater energy consumption. When global economic performance becomes more robust, oil demand is likely to grow faster than supply capacity can. As that happens, at some point before too long supply and demand could collide&mdash;gently or ferociously.</p>
<p>The case for the benign scenario rests on a steady evolution away from oil consumption in areas such as transportation, chemical production, power, and home heating. Moves by many major economies to impose tougher automotive fuel efficiency standards are a step in this direction. However, fully achieving the needed transition will take more stringent regulation, such as the abolition of fuel subsidies in oil-producing countries, Asia, and elsewhere, as well as widespread consumer behavior changes. And historically, governments, companies, and consumers have been disinclined to tackle tough policy choices or make big changes until their backs are against the wall. </p>
<!--roadblock-->
<p>This inertia suggests another scenario&mdash;one that&rsquo;s sufficiently plausible and underappreciated that we think it&rsquo;s worth exploring: the prospect that within this decade, the world could experience a period of significant volatility, with oil prices leaping upward and oscillating between $125 and $175 a barrel (or higher) for some time. The resulting economic pain would be significant. Economic modeling by our colleagues suggests that by 2020, global GDP would be about $1.5 trillion smaller than expected, if oil prices spiked and stayed high for several years. </p>
<p>But like any difficult transition, this one also would create major opportunities&mdash;for consumers of energy to differentiate their cost structures from competitors that aren&rsquo;t prepared and for a host of energy innovators to create substitutes for oil and tap into new sources of supply. Furthermore, if we endured a period of high and volatile prices that lasted for two or three years, by 2020 or so oil could face real competition from other energy sources. </p>

      <table  cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1" border="1">
        <tr><td><p><b>Russel Hensley and Andreas Zielke</b></p><p><strong>Regulatory standards already in place</strong> should dramatically enhance the efficiency of autos around the world. The European Union’s carbon emissions rules, for example, require annual improvements of 6 percent a year between 2015 and 2020. This implies, according to our analysis, that new cars driving on European roads will consume 40 to 50 percent less fuel in 2020 than they did in 2010. Regulators in China, Japan, and the United States are also eyeing ambitious rates of improvement, albeit from different starting points. US fuel economy levels in 2020—at around 40 miles a gallon—would lag behind China’s in that year and simply match Europe’s 2010 levels. </p><p>
The automotive industry, boxed in by fierce global competition and flat prices, has responded in the past by pushing design improvements and productivity gains that make room for costly new content, including technology required for meeting regulatory standards. Here’s one example: if you adjust for inflation the cost of a 2001 Toyota Camry, you see that by 2010, the price of the car to US consumers had actually dropped by $2,500 in real terms—although the 2010 Camry was better equipped and 10 percent more fuel efficient. As automakers work hard to meet new and tougher fuel economy standards, they are likely to follow the same playbook. The starting point: improving internal-combustion engines, which still offer significant opportunities to enhance efficiency and emissions performance. On the other hand, high battery costs would be likely to require automakers to raise prices, making a sweeping shift to electric vehicles more difficult between now and, say, 2020. </p><p>
A sustained oil price spike could well prompt regulators in mature economies to up the ante—for example, by increasing support for electric vehicles—and speed a broader adoption of tougher standards in developing economies, which will represent most of the new demand for transportation fuel going forward. This would create additional momentum for change.</p><p>
Still, for a major shift in the global automotive stock to occur within the decade, consumer behavior or technology would need to change in dramatic and currently unforeseen ways. One possibility would be for a higher proportion of car buyers to begin prioritizing fuel economy. While the importance of this factor varies around the world, our consumer research suggests that in two major car markets, Germany and the United States, car buyers rank this attribute outside the top ten they consider when buying a new car.<a class='link-footnote' rel='#footnote4' href='#' onclick='return false;'><sup>1</sup></a> <span id='footnote4' class='tooltip' style='display:none;'><span class='footnote-content'><span class='footnote-number'>1.</span><span class='footnote-text'>
We conducted online interviews with 2,200 new-vehicle buyers in Germany and the United States. The sample included purchasers of cars, trucks, flex-fuel vehicles, and diesel vehicles, weighted to match the demographic characteristics and brand and power train preferences of each national market. Consumer rankings of attributes, derived through conjoint analysis, represented the implied importance attached to them by buyers. Implied importance often differs from stated importance but can be more accurate because it is less likely to reflect respondents’ beliefs about the answers they are “expected” to provide. 
</span><span class='clear'></span> </span><span class='footnote-bottom'></span></span></p><p>Significant consumer change is likely to require compelling economics that don’t take many years of ownership to realize. Comparing Europe and the United States highlights the magnitude of the challenge: although gasoline prices are twice as high in the former, the share of autos running on oil-based derivatives (gasoline and diesel) and alternative fuels is roughly the same in both. For the economics to become more appealing, advanced technology, especially electric-vehicle batteries, would need to come down the cost curve faster than expected while oil and gasoline prices crossed some new threshold of pain.</p><div class="about-authors"><h3 class="sm black">About the authors</h3><p><b>Russell Hensley</b> is a principal in McKinsey’s Detroit office, and <b>Andreas Zielke</b> is a director in the Berlin office.</p></div></td></tr>

<p>To paint a clearer picture for senior executives of what such a world would mean for them&mdash;and how to prepare now&mdash;we asked several colleagues to join us in a thought experiment about the impact of a prolonged oil price spike. Russell Hensley and Andreas Zielke, from McKinsey&rsquo;s automotive practice, explain how intensified regulation already is leading a transition toward greater fuel economy, as well as the potential for higher oil prices to reinforce that momentum (see sidebar &ldquo;The automotive sector&rsquo;s road to greater fuel efficiency&rdquo;). Jonathan Ablett, Lowell Bryan, and Sven Smit, from McKinsey&rsquo;s strategy practice, assess the global economic impact of an oil price spike and the strategic implications of a slower-growth environment (see sidebar &ldquo;Anticipating economic headwinds&rdquo;). Finally, Knut Alicke and Tobias Meyer, from McKinsey&rsquo;s operations practice, describe energy-efficient supply chain strategies that some companies are already undertaking (see sidebar &ldquo;Building a supply chain that can withstand high oil prices&rdquo;). </p>

Indeed, we estimate that this type of shock would drive down global growth by 0.6 to 0.9 percentage points in the first year.<a class='link-footnote' rel='#footnote5' href='#' onclick='return false;'><sup>1</sup></a> <span id='footnote5' class='tooltip' style='display:none;'><span class='footnote-content'><span class='footnote-number'>1.</span><span class='footnote-text'>
All GDP and growth estimates in this article are the result of economic analysis we and our colleagues in McKinsey’s strategy practice conducted using the firm’s global-growth model, a tool for long-term scenario planning. The model links energy and capital markets to output and highlights relationships between growth and structural factors such as urbanization, education, and industry structure shifts. It can generate globally consistent scenarios for 20 countries, nine regions, and the world as a whole.
</span><span class='clear'></span> </span><span class='footnote-bottom'></span></span> Over time, as economies adjusted to the new higher prices (and shifted to different types of fuel, technologies, and production techniques) the impact would diminish. But the rate of global GDP growth would be affected for years. By 2020, the global economy would be between $1.1 trillion and $1.7 trillion smaller than the baseline outlook: the equivalent of losing Spain’s or Italy’s output for a year.</p><p>
A sustained growth drag of that magnitude would be serious, particularly for Europe and the United States, which are already suffering from sluggish recoveries and lingering unemployment. It could contribute to a double-dip recession in those markets and to trouble in the global economy as a whole, which also is fragile and faces other potential shocks, including sovereign-debt defaults, inflation in emerging markets, and problems in the Chinese financial sector.</p><p>
Senior executives can reduce the odds of getting whipsawed by the impact of an oil price spike if they push their planning teams to evaluate, at a fairly granular level, the likely growth impact of surging energy prices. Where are customers most vulnerable to energy cost increases, and where would they be less significant? In fact, our modeling suggests that the country-level impact of spiking oil prices would be quite uneven—and not just because of differences in the energy efficiency of various economies. Even more important, our analysis indicates, are variations in the relative size of the industrial sector in different countries. That means export-oriented advanced manufacturing economies, such as Germany and Japan, are more vulnerable than their relative energy efficiency might indicate (exhibit).</p>

In addition, business leaders should be preparing for a world in which energy-related growth slowdowns could occur in an oscillating and unpredictable manner. For example, oil prices might fly up to a point (far in excess of $125 a barrel) where global GDP growth completely stalled and new sources of energy supply rapidly became economic. That, in turn, might drive prices down somewhat, leading to a resumption of economic growth and a repetition of the cycle. In a world like that, management approaches that some companies experimented with during the financial crisis—such as shorter financial-planning cycles or even moving away from calendar-based approaches to budgeting and planning—may be important.<a class='link-footnote' rel='#footnote6' href='#' onclick='return false;'><sup>2</sup></a> <span id='footnote6' class='tooltip' style='display:none;'><span class='footnote-content'><span class='footnote-number'>2.</span><span class='footnote-text'>

</span><span class='clear'></span> </span><span class='footnote-bottom'></span></span></p><p>
When you combine the likelihood of oil price volatility with related uncertainties—such as the potential for swings in the dollar versus other currencies and commodities as global economic activity rebalances from the developed world toward emerging markets—you may want to abandon any presumption that you can predict medium-term oil prices.<a class='link-footnote' rel='#footnote7' href='#' onclick='return false;'><sup>3</sup></a> <span id='footnote7' class='tooltip' style='display:none;'><span class='footnote-content'><span class='footnote-number'>3.</span><span class='footnote-text'>

</span><span class='clear'></span> </span><span class='footnote-bottom'></span></span> Indeed, it may be more fruitful to stress-test your financial plans and strategies for different oil (and currency) prices, see what happens to the plans at the extremes, and then prepare for contingencies. One example: if oil prices rose significantly, that would accelerate the accumulation of capital by sovereign-wealth funds in oil-producing countries, complicating financing decisions and raising the importance of building strong relationships with a diverse group of capital suppliers.<a class='link-footnote' rel='#footnote8' href='#' onclick='return false;'><sup>4</sup></a> <span id='footnote8' class='tooltip' style='display:none;'><span class='footnote-content'><span class='footnote-number'>4.</span><span class='footnote-text'>

<h3>A delicate balance</h3>
<p>The world is very far from running out of oil. By most estimates, at least a trillion barrels of conventional oil still reside beneath the earth&rsquo;s surface, not to mention several trillion more barrels of oil or gas that could be extracted through unconventional sources, such as oil sands.</p>

<p><b>Knut Alicke and Tobias Meyer</b></p>
<p><strong>We don&rsquo;t need to look very hard</strong> for a live case study of what happens to global supply chains when oil prices spike. Just three years ago, when they shot up to $125 and beyond, it became painfully obvious to many companies that their supply chains were not viable at those levels.</p>
<p>Research we conducted at that time indicated that even if oil prices were as low as $40 a barrel, it would still make economic sense for companies to take a variety of actions that collectively would reduce the energy intensity of global supply chains by almost one-fourth. Energy intensity could be reduced by more than one-third if oil prices stayed above $100 a barrel for a prolonged period (exhibit). The potential would be even greater at higher prices. </p>

<p>Here are some of the opportunities that farsighted companies are beginning to act on:</p>
<p><b>Utilizing space-saving packages.</b> A retailer and a wholesaler partnered to create a new, stackable format for milk containers. As a result, they no longer need traditional shipping crates for truck transport, thus freeing up additional space for other cargo and avoiding the need to haul back the empty crates.</p>
<p><b>Operating larger ships and trucks.</b> Vale, the Brazil-based miner, took delivery this year of its first new ultralarge ore carrier, with 400,000 deadweight tons of capacity&mdash;more than twice that of today&rsquo;s standard vessel on the most important trade routes&mdash;to ship iron ore from Brazil to China. Scale is important because doubling the capacity of a transport asset typically increases its energy efficiency by one-fourth. The same goes for trucks too. In emerging markets, where average truck size is less than half that in OECD<a href="http://www.mckinsey.com/~/#" class="link-footnote" onclick="return false;" rel="#footnote9"><sup>1</sup></a> <span class="tooltip" id="footnote9" style="display: none;"><span class="footnote-content"><span class="footnote-number">1.</span><span class="footnote-text"> Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. </span><span class="clear"></span></span><span class="footnote-bottom"></span></span>countries, partly because of poorer infrastructure and smaller retail outlets, every percentage point of average truck size would reduce fuel consumption per unit of capacity by about 0.4 to 0.6 points. </p>
<p><b>Combining new technologies.</b> Maersk, the Danish container liner, used most of the available technological advances when it placed orders for its new 400-meter-long vessels, each with space for 18,000 20-foot container units. These vessels set a new benchmark in maritime energy efficiency by virtue of their size, slower speed, design improvements, and a waste heat&ndash;recovery system that reduces the engine&rsquo;s fuel consumption.</p>
<p><b>Switching to alternative fuels.</b> A road transport company recently estimated that it would save &euro;15,000 a year per truck by converting its small fleet to run on vegetable oil rather than traditional diesel fuel. Because of North America&rsquo;s recent flood of supply of natural gas, companies could also convert fleets to run on liquified natural gas (LNG) instead of diesel. </p>
<p><b>Practicing smarter driving.</b> Examining data collected by onboard computers, a logistics company found significant differences in the driving patterns and fuel consumption of drivers. Shifting to best practice could shave 10 percent off its $4 million annual fuel bill, with onboard computers helping employees drive more economically. </p>
<p>Regulators also have a role to play. In the United States, the fuel efficiency gain of lowering the cap on truck speeds on highways could be 7 to 10 percent. Truck speeds are already capped to lower levels in Europe. But there are still opportunities&mdash;for instance, allowing longer (and potentially heavier) truck/trailer combinations in Europe&rsquo;s road transport market could reduce its use of diesel by around 15 percent. </p>
<p>These examples are just the tip of the iceberg. Further existing technological opportunities&mdash;such as trucks with better aerodynamics and ocean vessels with new, friction-reducing hull coatings&mdash;are economical at the $100-a-barrel prices that have prevailed recently. High prices also should induce companies to cut the distance products travel. Moving final assembly into regions of demand would make it sensible to manufacture less valuable components there, such as primary packaging, manuals, or power cables for electric goods. An alternative is to ship products with low value density by slow and more energy efficient modes of transport. </p>
<p>Optimizing the energy efficiency of a supply chain&rsquo;s production process, location footprint, transportation, and inventory is a complex task made harder by inevitable tensions between the supply chain group and functions such as sales, service, and product development. There are thorny trade-offs&mdash;for example, between service levels and the lower speed of energy-efficient transport. </p>
<p>Part of the answer will be creating nimbler supply chains&mdash;for example, by using slower, more energy-efficient modes (such as ocean freight) for the base load and reserving the faster, less energy-efficient modes (such as air freight) for peak demand. CEOs also will need to facilitate meaningful discussion of important cross-functional supply chain issues so that executives can collaborate to uphold a company&rsquo;s best interests.</p>

<p>More relevant for prices, though, is how much spare oil production capacity exists in the world. Three million or four million barrels a day typically represents a comfortable buffer when the global economy is healthy. If that buffer shrinks, and markets expect strong demand growth to continue, prices can rise&mdash;sometimes dramatically. That&rsquo;s what happened prior to the 2008&ndash;09 financial crisis as surging emerging-market demand strained production capacity and prices approached $150 a barrel. This fly-up was short lived because the ensuing deep recession wiped out between three million and four million barrels a day of demand, sending oil prices sharply down. </p>
<p>During the sluggish recovery that followed, the global supply cushion shrank again, punctuated in the first half of 2011 by Libya&rsquo;s civil war, which disrupted supplies from that country and knocked off a million barrels a day of global capacity. That tightness set the stage for price fly-ups to $120 a barrel in the first half of this year and underscores the strength of the pre-2008 fundamentals. </p>
<p>Going forward, barring prolonged economic stagnation, demand growth for liquids<a href="http://www.mckinsey.com/~/#" class="link-footnote" onclick="return false;" rel="#footnote1"><sup>1</sup></a> <span class="tooltip" id="footnote1" style="display: none;"><span class="footnote-content"><span class="footnote-number">1.</span><span class="footnote-text"> For the sake of simplicity, in most of this article we use the term &ldquo;oil&rdquo; as short-hand for &ldquo;liquids,&rdquo; which comprise all liquid fuels derived from crude oil, as well as liquid fuels from natural-gas liquids (NGLs), biofuels, gas to liquids (GTLs), and coal to liquids (CTLs). </span><span class="clear"></span></span><span class="footnote-bottom"></span></span>is likely to chug ahead at around 1.5 percent a year. The pace would be even faster without the steady improvements in energy efficiency that we and other energy analysts foresee, particularly for cars and trucks as a result of technology improvements and stiffening regulatory standards that are already on the books.</p>
<p>Could supply growth accelerate to keep pace? Many industry analysts and our own supply model suggest that it won&rsquo;t be easy. Despite high oil prices for much of the past decade and surging investment outlays by many major private and national oil companies alike, capacity has risen by only slightly more than 1 percent a year during that time. The logistics, supply systems, and political alignment needed to extract new oil supplies make that a complex, expensive, and time-consuming business. And coaxing more output out of existing oil fields, which typically have high production-decline rates, also is costly and challenging. </p>
<p>Our current projections suggest that in a &ldquo;business as usual&rdquo; scenario,<a href="http://www.mckinsey.com/~/#" class="link-footnote" onclick="return false;" rel="#footnote2"><sup>2</sup></a> <span class="tooltip" id="footnote2" style="display: none;"><span class="footnote-content"><span class="footnote-number">2.</span><span class="footnote-text"> Our business-as-usual scenario assumes that between 2010 and 2020, the world economy will grow at the rate currently anticipated by many analysts (3.0 to 3.5 percent) and that oil prices won&rsquo;t significantly exceed $100 a barrel during this period. </span><span class="clear"></span></span><span class="footnote-bottom"></span></span>the world could reach a realistic supply capacity of around 100 million barrels a day by 2020, up from 91 million or 92 million today. That, however, would barely suffice to meet the roughly 100 million barrels of liquids the world would consume each day in such a scenario, up from 88 million or 89 million today. </p>
<h3>When supply and demand collide</h3>
<p>Simple math suggests that at some point, something has to give. And when it does, the world will have to start taking steps away from today&rsquo;s oil dependence. The question is how rapid and volatile that transition will be.</p>
<h3 class="sm black">The case for a gentle collision</h3>
<p>This critical shift could happen in an orderly fashion, without price spikes, if governments, companies, and consumers worked together to accelerate the adoption of measures that reduce demand. Indeed, a common denominator of current forecasts by industry analysts (including ourselves) is a gradual transition in most regions toward lower oil intensity in transportation, power, and residential heating. But according to our analysis, it would take more than current trends in oil conservation (spurred by existing legislation) for supply to meet demand if robust economic growth returned. </p>
<p>A few examples illustrate the scale and scope of the task facing the world if we are to realize a gentle transition. Governments would need to raise auto fuel efficiency standards further, and consumers would need to place greater emphasis on fuel economy when they bought new cars. Policy makers in several developing countries would need to abolish fuel subsidies so that consumers felt the real price of oil. Around the world, we&rsquo;d need to see deeper reductions in the use of oil for heating, power generation, and chemical manufacturing. Some transport by ships and heavy trucks would need to start shifting toward more reliance on natural gas as a fuel.</p>
<p>Changes like these could push oil supply and demand roughly into balance. However, they would require new policies and significant changes in how consumers and businesses behave. What&rsquo;s more, they would need to start now because it will take years before the changes required to constrain oil consumption begin to take effect. If we do not succeed in implementing these changes in a farsighted way, the system faces a risk of falling out of balance. </p>
<h3 class="sm black">Why the adjustment could be violent</h3>
<p>That brings us to a second scenario: it&rsquo;s possible to imagine global supply and demand for oil colliding faster, and more ferociously, resulting in a price spike as the global capacity buffer melted away. As we&rsquo;ve said, anticipated economic growth alone could cause demand to expand faster than supply. Another possible trigger: supply disruption, which does happen from time to time. The possibilities include an exceptionally severe hurricane in the Gulf of Mexico, violence in the Niger Delta, instability in Venezuela, and further tension in the Middle East.</p>
<p>If this new price spike took place, it could have a more significant impact on global consumption patterns than most executives expect (for audio commentary by Occo Roelofsen, see the interactive, &ldquo;How might a sustained oil price spike affect demand?&rdquo;). For starters, it would hit global growth, which in turn would immediately knock down oil demand. In addition, there would be some rapid behavioral effects, such as a reduction in car, air, and sea travel. If the spike lasted longer, it could cause several more structural shifts, such as prompting individuals to use different modes of transport or even to look for work closer to home, encouraging companies to reverse offshoring trends and bring supply chains closer to home, accelerating the substitution of videoconferences for air travel, and pushing the freight transport industry to adopt less oil-intensive modes. </p>

    </div></div>
<p>Because such shifts would take time, a high-price environment could last for years, not months, accelerating several other ongoing trends that, when combined, could lead to even further demand reductions. In other words, a sustained price spike could scare consumers, companies, and governments into more drastic responses&mdash;accelerating the transition to a less oil-dependent economy. A price spike of one to three years could be long enough to make governments raise standards for fuel efficiency at an accelerated pace and prompt automakers, reacting to regulatory changes, to modify their product-development road maps. Ultimately, all this would lead to more rapid efficiency gains and potentially to faster electric-vehicle penetration. </p>
<p>A prolonged price spike also could prompt investments in infrastructure needed to support the use of electric vehicles or other alternatives (such as natural gas and hydrogen) to traditional fuel sources. Such investments could have an impact on oil demand for trucking, light vehicles, and shipping. What&rsquo;s more, very high oil prices would intensify energy efficiency efforts up and down the supply chain and reduce the amount of plastics used in packaging, thus shrinking demand for oil in chemicals. Additional government action, in the form of either more stringent regulation on the use of plastics or subsidized financing that reduced the up-front cost to consumers of switching away from fuel oil in residential heating, could play an important role in this transition. </p>
<p>All along the way, of course, these reactions, plus slower global growth, would do their part to exert some downward pressure on oil prices. Expanded supply would also play a role. From now to 2020, OPEC<a href="http://www.mckinsey.com/~/#" class="link-footnote" onclick="return false;" rel="#footnote3"><sup>3</sup></a> <span class="tooltip" id="footnote3" style="display: none;"><span class="footnote-content"><span class="footnote-number">3.</span><span class="footnote-text"> Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. </span><span class="clear"></span></span><span class="footnote-bottom"></span></span>could increase its capacity by, say, two million barrels a day above currently assumed increases, and new investments in mature assets could slow decline rates, leading to an additional one million to two million barrels of daily production. Furthermore, additional investments in unconventional oil sources, such as oil sands, could increase supply by, say, one million to two million barrels a day. Biofuels, too, would have room to grow. But given the time it would take to pursue some of the available opportunities&mdash;and the danger that they could quickly become uneconomic once oil prices fell&mdash;the supply response is likely to be slower and more muted than that of demand. </p>
<p>In the end, once all the efficiency gains and supply expansions described above kicked in, the world could again wind up in balance and with significant excess capacity, so that eventually&mdash;perhaps by 2020, perhaps later&mdash;prices fell below the $80 to $100 range. Until then, however, given how slowly many of the demand changes would unfold, it&rsquo;s only prudent to imagine the possibility that the world could experience a prolonged period of both significant volatility and generally much higher prices. </p>
<h3>Preparing for the unexpected</h3>
<p>If the shock scenario outlined above unfolded, sustained high oil prices would challenge the top and bottom lines of many companies. However, high prices also could create opportunities for companies to differentiate themselves from competitors whose cost structures and operating approaches were ill suited to the new environment. And for companies on the front lines of the resource productivity revolution, a prolonged oil price increase would be beneficial. Providers of a range of new technologies&mdash;from car batteries for electric vehicles, to horizontal drilling and other tools for unconventional oil extraction, to biofuel production techniques, to electricity cogeneration equipment for manufacturers&mdash;would see their businesses grow, faster, than they would in a world of lower oil prices. </p>
<p>In many cases, these companies would be supplying or partnering with more established firms: oil companies in need of unconventional extraction technologies, auto manufacturers trying to create the winning vehicle of the future, and chemical companies hoping to take advantage of new feedstock sources, for example. From a strategic perspective, the interesting question is who would grab the most profitable positions in the new energy ecosystem.</p>
<p>No less fascinating are the managerial implications of the second-order and feedback effects that would occur as this ferocious collision played itself out. For example, our analysis suggests that even if prices subsequently fell, companies that pursued strategies for reducing their dependence on oil would be unlikely to regret it. One reason is that many strategies are already &ldquo;in the money&rdquo; at today&rsquo;s prices. If prices got high enough, they would concentrate the attention of consumers, businesses, and governments sufficiently to promote many positive-return investments that haven&rsquo;t been implemented so far, because of behavioral inertia. This development would accelerate the changes in our capital stock, while leaving them economically viable even if prices fell again. </p>
<p>Furthermore, many technologies could become significantly cheaper as demand for them increased and their providers went down learning curves. Examples include batteries for vehicles, highly efficient internal-combustion engines, and certain biofuel technologies, such as those that are cellulosic or perhaps even based on algae. In a high-price environment, more capital would flow into these technologies, enabling them to scale up. The time needed for them to become economically attractive would fall by five or even ten years compared with the time frame if oil prices stayed at lower levels, potentially making these technologies economically viable even if oil prices subsequently fell.</p>
<p>Indeed, a striking and often-underestimated feature of energy price shocks is the nonlinearity of their impact. Take electric vehicles. The market for car batteries would likely be about five or ten times larger if oil prices stayed for a considerable period at $150 a barrel than it would be at $100 a barrel. Few corporate-planning processes, however, place sufficient emphasis on extremes like this&mdash;even though these are precisely the scenarios that produce many of the most interesting opportunities and powerful threats for a business. Building corporate processes and skills that enable thoughtful reflection on a wider, more volatile range of outcomes could be a significant competitive differentiator in the years to come.</p>
<div class="articleBreak"></div>
<p>In the long run, these structural changes could well be a positive development for the world&mdash;resulting in more predictable and sustainable energy supplies and prices. But navigating the transition would be challenging and would reward the well prepared. The time is now for companies to start planning for the possibility of another price shock and a powerful market response.</p>

<strong>Retailers and</strong> consumer-packaged-goods (CPG) companies have long had access to vast amounts of transaction data: every day, companies capture information about every SKU sold to every customer at every store. In addition, companies regularly use sophisticated market-research techniques to answer a variety of questions: what products should we develop and sell? How much is the customer willing to pay? Which products should we discount and when? Which marketing vehicles will allow us to reach the most customers?</p>

Adding to the reams of data and market research already at their fingertips, consumer companies now have access to social-media information and other large data sets known as big data. In this article, we discuss the potential of big data and advanced analytics for the retail and CPG industries and examine what it takes to turn this potential into actual value.</p>

 
<h3>Immense possibilities</h3>

<p>
The combination of big data and advanced analytics offers retail and CPG companies countless opportunities across the value chain. In portfolio strategy and product development, for example, companies can get a more detailed understanding of consumer needs and attitudes and more precisely identify consumer segments, improving their ability to target the highest-value opportunities. They can measure the return on investment (ROI) for marketing spend across both traditional and newer marketing vehicles (such as social media), allowing them to shift marketing dollars to the most effective channels (see sidebar, &ldquo;Unraveling the Web: A new way to understand the online customer&rdquo;). Through detailed hourly analysis of in-stock rates by store, retailers can reduce out-of-stocks, provide a better shopping experience for consumers, and boost sales for both themselves and their CPG partners.</p>

<p>
Consumer-facing companies seeking to measure Web-site performance need to understand how well connected their site is to all the sites that influence purchasing decisions for their products, such as blogs and review sites. Simple &ldquo;clickstream&rdquo; analyses of how customers use and navigate to and from a company&rsquo;s Web site neglect a substantial set of other influences that bear on today&rsquo;s multitasking, site-hopping consumers who check e-mails, update their social network status, and catch up on the news&mdash;sometimes taking days to decide what to buy.</p>

<p>
For the past several years, we have tapped a panel of about 11,000 online users, broadly representative of the vast US online population. We log all the sites that these users visit during a six-month period. When a disproportionate number of users click on any two sites within a given period, typically a week, we consider the pairs to be connected. We collect all such pairs for companies, information providers, and others in a given industry.</p>

<p>
We present these relationships in a network map, which enables us to discern, at a granular level, a given company&rsquo;s network. The number of nodes and the length of the lines reflect the strength of the network. Short lines mean a strong connection; long lines represent a weak one. Strong connectivity implies significant overlap among their visitors, meaning the influencer is likely generating traffic for the connected site, even when users do not click directly from the influencer site to the connected site.</p>

The exhibit shows a network map of five online consumer-electronics retailers. Visitors to electronics retailers are likely to visit technology review, media, and news sites, among others. Retailer A has two strong influencer sites, while its competitors Retailer B and Retailer C have many more connections with influencer sites. This indicates that A could strengthen its relationships with influencer sites and boost traffic from them by investing in creative content partnerships, social media, and advertising. Companies can use influencer maps as they think about redistributing online advertising dollars to optimize connections with the sites that generate the most traffic. They can also marry this data with demographic information on customers to recognize those influencer sites that reach their desired customer segments.</p>

Big data and advanced analytics allow companies to make better, faster decisions in their day-to-day business and deliver improved performance. A European CPG company, for instance, revolutionized its retailer-specific assortments and planograms: by applying advanced analytics to consumer data, it was able to determine which SKUs were selling well in which retail formats and which SKUs to swap in and out to best meet consumer preferences. It is now seeing 10 percent sales growth in a low-growth category. And the potential impact isn&rsquo;t just in sales: recent research by McKinsey and Massachusetts Institute of Technology shows that companies that inject big data and analytics into their operations outperform their peers by 5 percent in productivity and 6 percent in profitability.<a class="link-footnote" rel="#footnote1" href="http://www.mckinsey.com/~/#" onclick="return false;"><sup>1</sup></a> <span id="footnote1" class="tooltip" style="display: none;"><span class="footnote-content"><span class="footnote-number">1.</span><span class="footnote-text">

<h3>Making it happen: Three ingredients</h3> 
<p>
We have found that fully exploiting data and analytics requires three capabilities. First, companies must be able to choose the right data and manage multiple data sources. Second, they need the capability to build advanced models that turn the data into insights. Third and most critical, management must undertake a transformational-change program so that the insights translate into effective action. (For more, see &ldquo;<a href="http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/marketing_sales/putting_big_data_and_advanced_analytics_to_work">Putting big data and advanced analytics to work</a>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<a href="http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/business_technology/making_data_analytics_work">Making data analytics work: Three key challenges</a>.&rdquo;)</p>

 
<h6>Managing the data</h6>

<p>
As they embark on a data-and-analytics journey, companies should take a &ldquo;decision back&rdquo; approach that begins by crisply answering one question: which decisions do we want to improve? A retailer may, for instance, seek to make better decisions about its promotional spending. Here, the range of decisions can be quite broad: do we want to optimize the design (number of pages, number of products on each page) of our promotional leaflets and circulars? Do we want to reassess the distribution of our circulars&mdash;which newspapers they should be inserted into, which addresses they should be delivered to, and so on? Do we want to rethink the product mix in our circulars? Each decision requires different data and analyses.</p>

<p>
Once they&rsquo;ve determined the specific business decisions they want to improve, consumer companies must collect and manage the data needed to conduct insightful analysis. In our experience, this entails three deliberate actions: creatively sourcing data, defining data-governance standards, and establishing an IT infrastructure.</p>

 

 
<p><em>Creatively source data</em>. Often, we find that a consumer company has the data it needs to unlock business improvement, but the data reside in different business groups within the company. In effect, organizational silos &ldquo;hide&rdquo; data from the analysts who can put it to work.</p>

<p>
For example, a specialty retailer sought to redesign the promotional mailings it sends to the more than five million members of its loyalty-card program. While the program had been successful, revenue and profit from loyal customers was stagnating. The retailer recognized that by combining data from various functional groups&mdash;in this case, customer loyalty, marketing, and merchandising finance&mdash;it could identify subsegments among its loyal customers and figure out what types of direct mail resulted in the most incremental profit for each segment. Once the retailer understood what data it needed, it developed a focused process to extract and clean the needed data and bring it together for this new purpose. We find that such a targeted approach often leads to success and supports quick wins.</p>

 
 

<p>
<em>Define data-governance standards.</em> Given the vast amount of data that retail and CPG companies collect and manage, ensuring the accuracy and reliability of data is a constant challenge. For instance, product information&mdash;package sizes, product descriptions, or even the category in which a product belongs&mdash;isn&rsquo;t always up-to-date in retailers&rsquo; databases. If the data are needed for analysis, the old saying &ldquo;garbage in, garbage out&rdquo; still largely applies.</p>

<p>
The increasing value of analysis-ready data mandates a mind-set shift: in particular, a shift from simply collecting the most easily available information and storing it as is, to establishing rigorous data-governance standards that call for clean, consistent data to be collected and stored in an analysis-ready state. The approach can be quite similar to the way retailers manage and maintain stores: they have processes and checks in place to ensure that store assets are properly cleaned, well designed, and periodically refurbished to maintain their useful life. In the same way, data-governance standards should define what data will be collected, the processes for checking and maintaining the data, and who in the organization is responsible for managing each data set.</p>

 
 

<p>
<em>Establish the IT infrastructure.</em> Companies need the IT infrastructure to store, easily access, combine, and analyze large data sets. Setting up the IT infrastructure requires close collaboration among business managers, analysts, and IT staff to ensure that data storage is designed in a way that meets business needs and technical IT requirements.</p>

<p>
One large retailer has taken big steps that improve data accessibility. The retailer recently announced plans to integrate its five-plus e-commerce Web sites onto one platform and move the corresponding data into a single in-house data repository. Whereas today sourcing of e-commerce data requires coordination across groups and can take several weeks, the new infrastructure will give the retailer&rsquo;s business leaders instant transparency and access to e-commerce data, accelerating insight generation and business impact.</p>

 
<h6>Translating data into insights</h6>

<p>
Managing the data is just the first step. Companies must next make sense of the flood of data&mdash;a task that requires sophisticated and sometimes complex analytic models. Two guiding principles can help. First, business users should be involved in the model-building process; they must understand the analytics and ensure that the model yields actionable results. Second, the modeling approach should aim for the least complex model that will deliver the needed insights.</p>

<p>
The power of these two steps became evident in a CPG company&rsquo;s efforts to assess its marketing-spend ROI. An external vendor independently built a model that suggested online paid-search ads delivered incredibly high ROI. The CPG company&rsquo;s marketing executives were surprised but trusted the results, even though they didn&rsquo;t understand the model. Later, the company&rsquo;s internal insights group partnered with the marketing function and built its own simplified model. The results were markedly different: this model showed ROI for paid-search ads to be 15 times lower than what the vendor&rsquo;s model estimated. Further investigation revealed that one of the external company&rsquo;s analysts, who had no knowledge of the business, had grouped the data erroneously&mdash;a mistake that a business practitioner would have easily caught. Moreover, the complexities of the vendor&rsquo;s model hid the error from view.</p>

 
<h6>Turning insights into effective frontline action</h6>

<p>
Gathering the right data and developing transparent models, however, won&rsquo;t yield impact unless companies can also turn data-driven insights into effective action on the front line. Companies must define new processes in a way that managers and frontline workers can readily understand and adopt. When a large CPG manufacturer implemented a new demand-forecasting system that generated automatic forecasts of each retail customer&rsquo;s inventory needs, sales managers weren&rsquo;t told that the new process included shipping of safety stock to every customer. Worried that their customers weren&rsquo;t receiving adequate stock, sales managers regularly overwrote the automatic forecasts. It took months before they changed their behavior and trusted the new system.</p>

<div class="articleBreak"></div>
<p>
We see great potential for consumer-facing organizations that adopt big data and advanced analytics as a platform for growth. Done right, a data-and-analytics initiative can yield outsize rewards for retailers and CPG companies alike.</p>

<p><strong>Just</strong> to keep pace with projected global growth between now and 2030, the world will have to spend $57 trillion on roads, bridges, ports, power plants, water facilities, and other forms of infrastructure. That&rsquo;s nearly 60 percent above the amount spent in the last 18 years and more than the estimated value of today&rsquo;s infrastructure. To deconstruct the problem of insufficient or inadequate infrastructure and to rethink the financing and delivery of better projects at lower cost, this package convenes an ongoing dialogue among global experts in construction, organization, funding, logistics, and government relations.</p>

<p>Improving the design, financing, and delivery of infrastructure on a global scale doesn&rsquo;t call for reinventing the wheel. <em><a href="http://www.mckinsey.com/~/insights/engineering_construction/infrastructure_productivity">Infrastructure productivity: How to save $1 trillion a year</a></em>, a report from the McKinsey Global Institute (MGI) and McKinsey&rsquo;s infrastructure practice, shows how practical steps can boost productivity in the sector&mdash;a long-time laggard&mdash;to achieve critical cost savings.</p>
<p>A related slideshow examines the challenge of investing in infrastructure at a time of high government deficits and explains the savings that productivity gains can provide. And in a group of video interviews, authorities such as former US secretary of state Madeleine Albright; Rockefeller Foundation president Judith Rodin; Raymond Ch&rsquo;ien, chairman of Hong Kong&rsquo;s MTR Corporation; Mark Wiseman, chief executive of the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board; and others explore how efforts to rethink infrastructure can improve projects, partnerships, and outcomes for society in addressing one of the world&rsquo;s most urgent issues.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>For the past six years</strong>, thousands of executives from around the world&mdash;across a range of industries and functional areas&mdash;have responded to a McKinsey survey<a class="link-footnote" rel="#footnote1" href="http://www.mckinsey.com/~/#" onclick="return false;"><sup>1</sup></a> <span id="footnote1" class="tooltip" style="display: none;"><span class="footnote-content"><span class="footnote-number">1.</span><span class="footnote-text"><em>McKinsey Quarterly</em> conducted the most recent survey online in June 2012 and received 3,542 responses from executives across industries, regions, and functional specialties. The survey received 4,261 responses in 2011, 3,249 responses in 2010, 1,695 responses in 2009, 1,988 responses in 2008, and 2,847 responses in 2007. The &ldquo;purpose&rdquo; results were calculated based on all respondents who were using any social (or Web 2.0) technology for the particular purpose indicated (for example, lowering purchasing costs). Each percentage represents the proportion of these respondents who are using a particular technology for a particular purpose and offers a useful way of comparing the relative importance of each technology.
</span><span class="clear"></span> </span><span class="footnote-bottom"></span></span> on how organizations are using social ( or Web 2.0) technologies. In 2009 we created an interactive  tool that links the data from these survey results and charts it to the emerging trends in Web 2.0 adoption.</p>
<!--roadblock-->
<p>
This interactive focuses on several of the survey&rsquo;s core questions&mdash;from what technologies and tools companies view as most important to what kind of investments, if any, organizations plan to make in Web 2.0 in the future. Our most recent survey  examines the business use of 13 social technologies and tools: blogs, collaborative document editing, mash-ups (a Web application that combines multiple sources of data into a single tool), microblogging, online videoconferencing, podcasts, prediction markets, rating, RSS (Really Simple Syndication), social networking, tagging, video sharing, and wikis. </p>
<p>
Using the interactive, you can track the performance of each technology through the years or customize the view to compare particular technologies side by side. The interactive also contains an audio guide from Michael Chui&mdash;a consultant with McKinsey and one of the drivers of the Web 2.0 research initiative&mdash;who takes you further inside the results and trends.</p>
<p>
This interactive archive will evolve from year to year as the survey progresses and as businesses continue to evaluate their use of and satisfaction with Web 2.0. </p>

<p><strong>Historically,</strong> the infrastructure industry has been resistant to innovation and productivity gains, in part because of the piecemeal approach to many projects. In this video, Judith Rodin, president of the Rockefeller Foundation, describes her philanthropy&rsquo;s push to plan projects systematically and to combine various elements holistically, including the use of natural &ldquo;soft&rdquo; infrastructure assets, such as forests, alongside &ldquo;hard&rdquo; construction assets. She also explores the challenges to infrastructure planning posed by Asia&rsquo;s booming cities and growing middle classes. This interview was conducted by McKinsey&rsquo;s Rik Kirkland in Istanbul, Turkey, in November 2012. What follows is an edited transcript of her remarks.</p>
<p>For more on this topic, also read <em><a href="http://www.mckinsey.com/~/insights/engineering_construction/infrastructure_productivity">Infrastructure productivity: How to save $1 trillion a year</a></em>, a report from the McKinsey Global Institute (MGI).</p>
<h4>Interview transcript</h4>
<h3>Innovating through a holistic approach</h3>
<p>Rockefeller is always focused on innovation, right from its beginning. We think that one of the innovations in infrastructure is really taking a systems approach. And that means not thinking about a specific project, not thinking about a specific situation like &ldquo;water only&rdquo; or &ldquo;transport only&rdquo; or &ldquo;energy only,&rdquo; but really looking systemically around what kinds of infrastructure need to support healthy, active, accessible communities or nations. And with that innovative way of thinking, you actually do approach infrastructure differently.</p>
<p>You think about both &ldquo;hard&rdquo; and &ldquo;soft&rdquo; infrastructure holistically. Sometimes it&rsquo;s better to plant mangroves and think about coastal restoration than it is to build a seawall. Or at least when you&rsquo;re building hard infrastructure, to think about the soft infrastructure solutions. Sometimes it&rsquo;s better, now that we have those materials, to build your streets and sidewalks with material that&rsquo;s porous. The kind of porous material now is an innovation, because it allows the material to absorb water more quickly and release it more slowly. Sometimes it&rsquo;s preventing construction. We worked in Da Nang with the municipal government and it was very clear that construction that they had already permitted for new hotels on the beach would have flooded twice a year, back into the poorest communities right behind it.</p>
<p>And to their credit, they stopped the project. They moved where the hotels would be. They did some restoration for the poorer communities as well. So that&rsquo;s what we mean by a systemic, holistic approach. So everywhere that there is innovation, whether it&rsquo;s technological innovation or systems innovation, it&rsquo;s critical to apply that to thinking about how to develop infrastructure going forward.</p>
<h3>Anticipating the Asia challenge</h3>
<p>The huge demographic growth that we will see over the next 20 to 50 years will be in Asia, primarily in Asian cities. And so, 70 percent of that population growth will occur there. Often those cities are on river deltas or on fragile ecologies of one sort or another. And they will not be able to tolerate this kind of population growth that they will experience without intervention. Rockefeller&rsquo;s been working in what are called &ldquo;second tier&rdquo; cities&mdash;that is, cities that are not yet the size of Mumbai or Bangkok, but are predicted to be, in the relatively near term.</p>
<p>We do that because we think that we can intervene in their expansion plans. And so we work first with the town officials. All of the municipal government and often the state and national government participate in doing a vulnerability assessment. That will often include hydrology mapping and a variety of other assessment tools that allow them to understand what compromises they&rsquo;ll need to make, or not, in terms of their infrastructure planning.</p>
<p>And then we actually support the construction of a variety of both soft and hard infrastructure. Sometimes it&rsquo;s early warning systems, sometimes it&rsquo;s dams, intervening in dams above the city in ways that will prevent flooding. So you&rsquo;re working at a more regional level. One of the things we&rsquo;ve been struck by is how many of the municipalities in these regions don&rsquo;t have strong municipal governance. They also don&rsquo;t have municipal bonding authority. So working with them on how the financing structures and some innovative financing sources can be brought to bear has been another really important piece of the work.</p>

      <h3>Foreseeing the potential rise of Africa's economic lions</h3>
      <p>MGI's London-based Director Charles Roxburgh and South Africa-based Principal Arend Van Wamelen discuss the sources and staying power of Africa's economic growth, the continent's compelling business opportunities, and the rise of the African urban consumer.</p>

<p class="mck_h3_md"><h3>Africa's growth acceleration was widespread, with 27 of its 30 largest economies expanding more rapidly after 2000.</h3></p>
<p>All sectors contributed, including resources, finance, retail, agriculture, transportation and telecommunications. Natural resources directly accounted for just 24 percent of the continent's GDP growth from 2000 through 2008. Key to Africa's growth surge were improved political and macroeconomic stability and microeconomic reforms. </p>
<p class="mck_h3_md"><h3>Future economic growth will be supported by Africa's increasing ties to the global economy.</h3></p>
<p>Rising demand for commodities is driving buyers around the world to pay dearly for Africa's natural riches and to forge new types of partnerships with producers. And Africa is gaining greater access to international capital; total foreign capital flows into Africa rose from $15 billion in 2000 to a peak of $87 billion in 2007. </p>
<p class="mck_h3_md"><h3>Africa's economic growth is creating substantial new business opportunities that are often overlooked by global companies.</h3></p>
<p>MGI projects that at least four groups of industries&mdash;consumer-facing industries, agriculture, resources, and infrastructure&mdash;together could generate as much as $2.6 trillion in revenue annually by 2020, or $1 trillion more than today. </p>
<p class="mck_h3_md"><h3>Today the rate of return on foreign investment in Africa is higher than in any other developing region.</h3></p>
<p>Early entry into African economies provides opportunities to create markets, establish brands, shape industry structures, influence customer preferences, and establish long-term relationships. Business can help build the Africa of the future.</p>
<p class="mck_h3_md"><h3>The rise of the African urban consumer also will fuel long-term growth.</h3></p>
<p>Today, 40 percent of Africans live in urban areas, a portion close to China's and continuing to expand. The number of households with discretionary income is projected to rise by 50 percent over the next 10 years, reaching 128 million. By 2030, the continent's top 18 cities could have combined spending power of $1.3 trillion. </p>
<p>To understand the growth opportunities and challenges of individual economies, MGI developed a framework that groups them in four broad clusters: diversified economies, oil exporters, transition economies, and pre-transition economies. Though imperfect, this framework can guide business leaders and investors developing strategies for the continent and policymakers working to sustain growth.</p>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Almost overnight</strong>, China has become the world&rsquo;s second-largest e-tail market, with estimates as high as $210 billion for revenues in 2012 and a compound annual growth rate of 120 percent since 2003. The country&rsquo;s retail sector already is among the most wired anywhere&mdash;e-tailing commanded about 5 to 6 percent of total retail sales in 2012, compared with 5 percent in the United States&mdash;while it is distinctly different from that of other countries. Only a small portion of Chinese e-tailing takes place directly between consumers and retailers, whether online pure plays or brick-and-mortar businesses on retailers&rsquo; own Web sites. Instead, most occurs on digital marketplaces. What&rsquo;s more, Chinese e-tailing is not just replacing traditional retail transactions but also stimulating consumption that would not otherwise take place. Finally, e-tailing may catalyze a &ldquo;leapfrog&rdquo; move by the broader retail sector, putting it on a fast track to a more digital future. These are among the key findings of <em>China&rsquo;s e-tail revolution: Online shopping as a catalyst for growth</em>, a new report by the McKinsey Global Institute. </p>
<h3>Structural differences </h3>
<p>Some 90 percent of Chinese electronic retailing occurs on virtual marketplaces&mdash;sprawling e-commerce platforms where manufacturers, large and small retailers, and individuals offer products and services to consumers through online storefronts on megasites analogous to eBay or Amazon Marketplace.<a href="http://www.mckinsey.com/~/#" class="link-footnote" onclick="return false;" rel="#footnote1"><sup>1</sup></a> <span class="tooltip" id="footnote1" style="display: none;"><span class="footnote-content"><span class="footnote-number">1</span><span class="footnote-text">In the United States, marketplaces represent 20 to 30 percent of commerce.</span><span class="clear"></span></span><span class="footnote-bottom"></span></span> The megasites include PaiPai, Taobao, and Tmall, which in turn are owned by bigger e-commerce groups. A large and growing network of third-party service providers offers sellers marketing and site-design services, payment fulfillment, delivery and logistics, customer service, and IT support. </p>
<p>By contrast, in the United States, Europe, and Japan, the dominant model involves brick-and-mortar retailers (such as Best Buy, Carrefour, Darty, Dixons, and Wal-mart) or pure-play online merchants (such as Amazon), which run their own sites and handle the details of commerce. Developed markets have major specialized retail chains in the e-commerce arena. In China, such independent merchants account for only 10 percent of e-tailing sales. Although still in the early stages of growth, China&rsquo;s e-tail ecosystem is profitable, logging margins of around 8 to 10 percent of earnings before interest, taxes, and amortization&mdash;slightly higher than those of average physical retailers. </p>
<h3>Powering consumption </h3>
<p>This unique e-tailing engine is enabling China&rsquo;s shift from an investment-oriented society to one that&rsquo;s more consumption driven. E-tailing, our research indicates, is not simply a replacement channel for purchases that otherwise would have taken place offline. Instead, it appears to be spurring incremental consumption, particularly in less developed regions. By analyzing consumption patterns in 266 Chinese cities accounting for over 70 percent of online retail sales, we found that a dollar of online consumption replaces roughly 60 cents of sales in offline stores and generates around 40 cents of incremental consumption (Exhibit 1). It&rsquo;s important to note that the data sets behind this analysis don&rsquo;t cover the full market. Our approximations do, however, provide a preliminary picture of what&rsquo;s occurring in China and permit a rough calculation of the extent to which e-tailing may be boosting consumption there. (These estimates suggest that the channel may have added 2 percent of incremental value to private consumption in 2011 and could generate 4 to 7 percent in incremental consumption by 2020.) </p>
<p>

      <p>Online spending raises China's total consumption—and the effect is even more pronounced in less developed areas.

</p>
<p>E-tailing&rsquo;s impact is more pronounced in China&rsquo;s underdeveloped small and midsize cities. We found that while incomes in these urban areas are lower, their online shoppers spend almost as much money online as do people in some larger, more prosperous cities&mdash;and also spend a larger portion of their disposable income online (Exhibit 2). For these shoppers, the utility of online purchasing may be higher, since they now have access to products and brands previously not available to them, in locations where many retailers have yet to establish beachheads. </p>

</p>
<p>Further boosting online purchases is the fact that e-tailing has cut consumer prices: depending on the category, they are, on average, 6 to 16 percent lower online than in China&rsquo;s stores.<a href="http://www.mckinsey.com/~/#" class="link-footnote" onclick="return false;" rel="#footnote2"><sup>2</sup></a> <span class="tooltip" id="footnote2" style="display: none;"><span class="footnote-content"><span class="footnote-number">2</span><span class="footnote-text">When adjusted for the portion of products common to both e-tailing and traditional retailing (measured in stock-keeping units, or SKUs), the price effect is lower: 4 to 9 percent.</span><span class="clear"></span></span><span class="footnote-bottom"></span></span> Apparel, household products, and recreation and education are the categories where price discounts are greatest. They are also the three largest online retail segments (Exhibit 3). </p>

<h3>The leapfrog effect </h3>
<p>China&rsquo;s retailing industry, coming of age in an era of digital disruption, will probably follow a trajectory different from that of retail sectors in other markets. In developed nations, the industry typically followed a three-stage path. It began with the rise of regionally dominant players. This field then consolidated into a smaller number of national leaders. Eventually, online players challenged them, and the industry became multichannel. Some brick-and-mortar players (Tesco and Wal-Mart Stores, for instance) have embraced a multichannel strategy, while others (such as Borders in the United States and Jessops and Woolworths in the United Kingdom) have been driven from the market. </p>
<p>China differs from these developed markets, however, because a crop of national leaders has yet to emerge in traditional retailing. Building stores across China&rsquo;s considerable geography, with its many smaller cities, takes both time and high levels of investment. As a result, China&rsquo;s largest brick-and-mortar retailers have captured a smaller share of the country&rsquo;s overall retail market than have major players in the United States and elsewhere: the top five retailers by category hold less than 20 percent of the market&mdash;much lower than US levels of 24 to 60 percent in comparable categories. </p>
<p>In China, the combined effects of the complexities of store expansion and a distinctive model of e-tailing could lead to a different retail dynamic: as e-tailing continues to grow, China&rsquo;s industry may leapfrog the second (national) stage, passing directly from the regional to the multichannel one. In fact, China&rsquo;s online ecosystem of marketplaces and agile support services has grown rapidly precisely because it can exploit the inefficiencies and higher costs of China&rsquo;s existing retail market. Already, the major online companies Alibaba (which owns marketplaces such as Taobao) and 360buy.com (focusing on sales of electronics) have established a prominent national role, ranking among China&rsquo;s top ten retailers. </p>
<h3>Coming next</h3>
<p>The view forward may be more impressive. We estimate that by 2020, as 15 to 20 percent annual growth rates (before inflation) continue, e-tailing could generate $420 billion to $650 billion in sales, and China&rsquo;s market will equal that of the United States, Japan, the United Kingdom, Germany, and France combined today.<a href="http://www.mckinsey.com/~/#" class="link-footnote" onclick="return false;" rel="#footnote3"><sup>3</sup></a> <span class="tooltip" id="footnote3" style="display: none;"><span class="footnote-content"><span class="footnote-number">3</span><span class="footnote-text">This e-tailing market-size forecast is based on regression analysis of 17 countries from 2003 to 2011.</span><span class="clear"></span></span><span class="footnote-bottom"></span></span> Patterns of future change are coming into focus. </p>
<p><em>Retail modernization </em></p>
<p>E-tailing will continue to transform the retail sector. As competition among e-tailers has lowered prices, it has also both increased the size of the consumer market and created efficiencies in the important adjacent markets that support e-commerce&mdash;logistics, supply chains, IT services, and digital marketing. This efficiency edge should force brick-and-mortar retailers to modernize and pave the way to a more efficient coordination of supply and demand across the Chinese economy. </p>
<p>One cloud hanging over the e-tailing scene is a growing talent shortage resulting from heady growth. Eventually, it could raise labor costs and hamper expansion plans unless e-tailers significantly improve their labor productivity, which at best matches that of physical retailers. The good news is that if the online ecosystem learns from developed markets, e-tailing&rsquo;s productivity should rise as high as two to four times that of offline retailers. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, China&rsquo;s store-based retailers, and the manufacturers that supply them, will need to place some new bets&mdash;soon. Many have yet to fully embrace multichannel strategies, focusing instead on the sizable growth and consolidation opportunities still available in their brick-and-mortar businesses. They&rsquo;ll have to decide whether to join existing e-tail marketplaces or establish their own online storefronts and whether to own parts of the value chain (such as distribution and IT) or use third-party suppliers. </p>
<p><em>To what extent will e-tailers bypass virtual marketplaces?</em> </p>
<p>As the e-tail ecosystem diversifies and matures, merchants that today use digital marketplaces may find it tempting to pursue growth by operating independently. To do so, these companies must go beyond current strategies, which depend chiefly on products and prices, where competition already is fierce. Instead, to build a strong online brand, e-tailers will need to dedicate management resources and investments to creating an attractive package of value propositions&mdash;superior customer service, fast and reliable delivery, a better shopping experience, or more targeted marketing. That will require a new level of capabilities and, perhaps, partnerships with experienced players outside China. </p>
<p><em>Consumer companies: Threats and opportunities</em> </p>
<p>Since marketplaces hold the leading share of China&rsquo;s e-tailing market, they are a natural place for consumer-products manufacturers to focus when they enter China&mdash;or grow outside its leading cities. Marketplace ecosystems provide a business infrastructure to reach customers at a reasonable cost. That infrastructure is particularly valuable for new entrants, which may find it an economical way of testing a market&rsquo;s temperature. Uniqlo, for one, used a combination of marketplaces and service providers when it started its online apparel business in China in 2009. </p>
<p>At the same time, however, e-tailing innovation is creating more competition. New entrants have sprung up on the major e-tail marketplaces (known as Taobrands on the Taobao marketplace) to sell lines such as apparel and cosmetics directly to consumers. With products sourced straight from workshops and OEM factories, and sales stimulated by targeted marketing campaigns, these immensely popular companies offer good quality and attractive prices. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, China&rsquo;s model and innovations are spilling beyond its borders. Other emerging economies are developing e-tailing markets that could follow China&rsquo;s business model&mdash;and potentially achieve similar growth rates. China&rsquo;s new marketplace sellers are expanding internationally, leveraging their direct access to Chinese workshops and OEM factories. Global consumer-goods players should be ready to face competition from Chinese small and midsize enterprises and microbusinesses selling directly through marketplaces in emerging economies. </p>
<div class="articleBreak"></div>
<p>China may have largely sat out the 19th-century Industrial Revolution, but as the explosion of its new consuming class continues to reshape 21st-century economic life, e-tailing and the Internet revolution have important roles to play. E-tailing is boosting the Chinese consumer&rsquo;s propensity to spend. The distinctive course charted by the country&rsquo;s e-tailers is having an impact on merchants, consumer-product companies, and value-chain partners. And it&rsquo;s widening the field of opportunities for players both in and outside China. With continued robust growth, changes in industry business patterns that are already under way will only grow in importance. </p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>China is innovating.</strong> Some of its achievements are visible: a doubling of the global percentage of patents granted to Chinese inventors since 2005, for example, and the growing role of Chinese companies in the wind- and solar-power industries. Other developments&mdash;such as advances by local companies in domestically oriented consumer electronics, instant messaging, and online gaming&mdash;may well be escaping the notice of executives who aren&rsquo;t on the ground in China.</p>
<p>As innovation gains steam there, the stakes are rising for domestic and multinational companies alike. Prowess in innovation will not only become an increasingly important differentiator inside China but should also yield ideas and products that become serious competitors on the international stage.</p>
<!--roadblock-->
<p>Chinese companies and multinationals bring different strengths and weaknesses to this competition. The Chinese have traditionally had a bias toward innovation through commercialization&mdash;they are more comfortable than many Western companies are with putting a new product or service into the market quickly and improving its performance through subsequent generations. It is common for products to launch in a fraction of the time that it would take in more developed markets. While the quality of these early versions may be variable, subsequent ones improve rapidly.<a href="http://www.mckinsey.com/~/#" class="link-footnote" onclick="return false;" rel="#footnote1"><sup>1</sup></a> <span class="tooltip" id="footnote1" style="display: none;"><span class="footnote-content"><span class="footnote-number">1.</span><span class="footnote-text"> Commercialization differs from <i>shanzhai</i>, or &ldquo;copycat innovation.&rdquo; Many executives in the developed world misunderstand <i>shanzhai</i>, believing that it is purely the replication of an innovation developed in another market. Although this does occur, products developed through the <i>shanzhai</i> approach incorporate features specifically for the Chinese market. <i>Shanzhai</i> is quite prevalent in consumer products categories such as packaged goods and electronics. It can also be found in the business-to-business domain, where local companies produce knockoffs of successful foreign products or business models. </span><span class="clear"></span></span><span class="footnote-bottom"></span></span></p>
<p>Chinese companies also benefit from their government&rsquo;s emphasis on indigenous innovation, underlined in the latest five-year plan. Chinese authorities view innovation as critical both to the domestic economy&rsquo;s long-term health and to the global competitiveness of Chinese companies. China has already created the seeds of 22 Silicon Valley&ndash;like innovation hubs within the life sciences and biotech industries. In semiconductors, the government has been consolidating innovation clusters to create centers of manufacturing excellence.</p>
<p>But progress isn&rsquo;t uniform across industries, and innovation capabilities vary significantly: several basic skills are at best nascent within a typical Chinese enterprise. Pain points include an absence of advanced techniques for understanding&mdash;analytically, not just intuitively&mdash;what customers really want, corporate cultures that don&rsquo;t support risk taking, and a scarcity of the sort of internal collaboration that&rsquo;s essential for developing new ideas.</p>

        <tr><td><p>
In innovative sectors such as biotechnology, electric vehicles, pharmaceuticals, and solar energy, the number of patent applications from Chinese companies is rising. In fact, Huawei and ZTE ranked among the world’s top five corporate patent registrants by volume in 2010. Intensifying patent activity reflects a growing recognition that intellectual property is essential to value. As this mentality takes hold, domestic innovators may pressure the government to create a more modern intellectual-property system.</p><p>
Currently, China recognizes three categories of patents: invention (what most people elsewhere think of as worthy of a patent), utility (a new use for something that already exists), and design. Invention patents run for 20 years, the others only for 10. Patent reform—such as reducing the duration of design or utility patents and raising the bar for what can be registered in those categories—would be a powerful way for the Chinese government to signal its seriousness about promoting indigenous innovation. If China decides to move ahead with patent reform, a desire for global consistency could well make it a high-priority multilateral issue.</p><p>Without patent reform, companies must rely on one of two strategies for protecting intellectual property. The first is to continue to outrun the competition by developing increasingly innovative solutions or building in protection through complex integration that is difficult to reverse-engineer. The second is to create easily identifiable technology “signatures” that would be hard to refute in legal proceedings.</p></td></tr>

<p>Multinationals are far stronger in these areas but face other challenges, such as high attrition among talented Chinese nationals that can slow efforts to create local innovation centers. Indeed, the contrasting capabilities of domestic and multinational players, along with the still-unsettled state of intellectual-property protection (see sidebar, &ldquo;Improving the patent process&rdquo;), create the potential for topsy-turvy competition, creative partnerships, and rapid change. This article seeks to lay out the current landscape for would-be innovators and to describe some of the priorities for domestic and multinational companies that hope to thrive in it.</p>
<h3>China&rsquo;s innovation landscape</h3>
<p>Considerable innovation is occurring in China in both the business- to-consumer and business-to-business sectors. Although breakthroughs in either space generally go unrecognized by the broader global public, many multinational B2B competitors are acutely aware of the innovative strides the Chinese are making in sectors such as communications equipment and alternative energy. Interestingly, even as multinationals struggle to cope with Chinese innovation in some areas, they seem to be holding their own in others.</p>
<h3 class="sm black">The business-to-consumer visibility gap</h3>
<p>When European and US consumers think about what China makes, they reflexively turn to basic items such as textiles and toys, not necessarily the most innovative products and rarely associated with brand names.</p>
<p>In fact, though, much product innovation in China stays there. A visit to a shop of the Suning Appliance chain, the large Chinese consumer electronics retailer, is telling. There, you might find an Android-enabled television complete with an integrated Internet-browsing capability and preloaded apps that take users straight to some of the most popular Chinese Web sites and digital movie-streaming services. Even the picture quality and industrial design are comparable to those of high-end televisions from South Korean competitors.</p>
<p>We observe the same home-grown innovation in business models. Look, for example, at the online sector, especially Tencent&rsquo;s QQ instant-messaging service and the Sina Corporation&rsquo;s microblog, Weibo. These models, unique to China, are generating revenue and growing in ways that have not been duplicated anywhere in the world. QQ&rsquo;s low, flat-rate pricing and active marketplace for online games generate tremendous value from hundreds of millions of Chinese users.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s keeping innovative products and business models confined to China? In general, its market is so large that domestic companies have little incentive to adapt successful products for sale abroad. In many cases, the skills and capabilities of these companies are oriented toward the domestic market, so even if they want to expand globally, they face high hurdles. Many senior executives, for example, are uncomfortable doing business outside their own geography and language. Furthermore, the success of many Chinese models depends on local resources&mdash;for example, lower-cost labor, inexpensive land, and access to capital or intellectual property&mdash;that are difficult to replicate elsewhere. Take the case of mobile handsets: most Chinese manufacturers would be subject to significant intellectual property&ndash;driven licensing fees if they sold their products outside China.</p>
<h3 class="sm black">Successes in business to business</h3>
<p>Several Chinese B2B sectors are establishing a track record of innovation domestically and globally. The Chinese communications equipment industry, for instance, is a peer of developed-world companies in quality. Market acceptance has expanded well beyond the historical presence in emerging markets to include Europe&rsquo;s most demanding customers, such as France T&eacute;l&eacute;com and Vodafone.</p>
<p>Pharmaceuticals are another area where China has made big strides. In the 1980s and 1990s, the country was a bit player in the discovery of new chemical entities. By the next decade, however, China&rsquo;s sophistication had grown dramatically. More than 20 chemical compounds discovered and developed in China are currently undergoing clinical trials.</p>

<p class="grayNote small">Workers produce solar-cell modules in a factory in China&rsquo;s Jiangsu Province.<br>&copy; Imaginechina/Corbis</p>
<p>China&rsquo;s solar- and wind-power industries are also taking center stage. The country will become the world&rsquo;s largest market for renewable-energy technology, and it already has some of the sector&rsquo;s biggest companies, providing critical components for the industry globally. Chinese companies not only enjoy scale advantages but also, in the case of solar, use new manufacturing techniques to improve the efficiency of solar panels.</p>
<p>Success in B2B innovation has benefited greatly from friendly government policies, such as establishing market access barriers; influencing the nature of cross-border collaborations by setting intellectual-property requirements in electric vehicles, high-speed trains, and other segments; and creating domestic-purchasing policies that favor Chinese-made goods and services. Many view these policies as loading the dice in favor of Chinese companies, but multinationals should be prepared for their continued enforcement.</p>

<p>Despite recent setbacks, an interesting example of how the Chinese government has moved to build an industry comes from high-speed rail. Before 2004, China&rsquo;s efforts to develop it had limited success. Since then, a mix of two policies&mdash;encouraging technology transfer from multinationals (in return for market access) and a coordinated R&amp;D-investment effort&mdash;has helped China Railways&rsquo; high-speed trains to dominate the local industry. The multinationals&rsquo; revenue in this sector has remained largely unchanged since the early 2000s.</p>
<p>But it is too simplistic to claim that government support is the only reason China has had some B2B success. The strength of the country&rsquo;s scientific and technical talent is growing, and local companies increasingly bring real capabilities to the table. What&rsquo;s more, a number of government-supported innovation efforts have <i>not</i> been successful. Some notable examples include attempts to develop an indigenous 3G telecommunications protocol called TDS-CDMA and to replace the global Wi-Fi standard with a China-only Internet security protocol, WAPI.</p>
<h3 class="sm black">Advantage, multinationals?</h3>
<p>Simultaneously, multinationals have been shaping China&rsquo;s innovation landscape by leveraging global assets. Consider, for example, the joint venture between General Motors and the Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation, which adapted a US minivan (Buick&rsquo;s GL8) for use in the Chinese market and more recently introduced a version developed in China, for China. The model has proved hugely popular among executives.</p>
<p>In fact, the market for vehicles powered by internal-combustion engines remains dominated by multinationals, despite significant incentives and encouragement from the Chinese government, which had hoped that some domestic automakers would emerge as leaders by now. The continued strength of multinationals indicates how hard it is to break through in industries with 40 or 50 years of intellectual capital. Transferring the skills needed to design and manufacture complex engineering systems has proved a significant challenge requiring mentorship, the right culture, and time.</p>
<p>We are seeing the emergence of similar challenges in electric vehicles, where early indications suggest that the balance is swinging toward the multinationals because of superior product quality. By relying less on purely indigenous innovation, China is trying to make sure the electric-vehicle story has an ending different from that of its telecommunications protocol efforts. The government&rsquo;s stated aspiration of having more than five million plug-in hybrid and battery electric vehicles on the road by 2020 is heavily supported by a mix of extensive subsidies and tax incentives for local companies, combined with strict market access rules for foreign companies and the creation of new revenue pools through government and public fleet-purchase programs. But the subsidies and incentives may not be enough to overcome the technical challenges of learning to build these vehicles, particularly if multinationals decline to invest with local companies.</p>
<h3>Four priorities for innovators in China</h3>
<p>There&rsquo;s no magic formula for innovation&mdash;and that goes doubly for China, where the challenges and opportunities facing domestic and multinational players are so different. Some of the priorities we describe here, such as instilling a culture of risk taking and learning, are more pressing for Chinese companies. Others, such as retaining local talent, may be harder for multinationals. Collectively, these priorities include some of the critical variables that will influence which companies lead China&rsquo;s innovation revolution and how far it goes.</p>
<img alt="China high-speed train" src="http://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/McKinsey/dotcom/Insights/Asia-Pacific/A CEOs guide to innovation in China/ChinaTrain.ashx?mw=510">
<p class="grayNote small">A Chinese-built high-speed train at the Wuhan Railway Station, in Wuhan, China.<br>&copy; Guo Xulei/Xinhua Press/Corbis</p><h3 class="sm black">Deeply understanding Chinese customers</h3>
<p>Alibaba&rsquo;s Web-based trading platform, Taobao, is a great example of a product that emerged from deep insights into how customers were underserved and their inability to connect with suppliers, as well as a sophisticated understanding of the Chinese banking system. This dominant marketplace enables thousands of Chinese manufacturers to find and transact with potential customers directly. What looks like a straightforward eBay-like trading platform actually embeds numerous significant innovations to support these transactions, such as an ability to facilitate electronic fund transfers and to account for idiosyncrasies in the national banking system. Taobao wouldn&rsquo;t have happened without Alibaba&rsquo;s deep, analytically driven understanding of customers.</p>
<p>Few Chinese companies have the systematic ability to develop a deep understanding of customers&rsquo; problems. Domestic players have traditionally had a manufacturing-led focus on reapplying existing business models to deliver products for fast-growing markets. These &ldquo;push&rdquo; models will find it increasingly hard to unlock pockets of profitable growth. Shifting from delivery to creation requires more local research and development, as well as the nurturing of more market-driven organizations that can combine insights into detailed Chinese customer preferences with a clear sense of how the local business environment is evolving. Requirements include both research techniques relevant to China and people with the experience to draw out actionable customer insights.</p>
<p>Many multinationals have these capabilities, but unless they have been operating in China for some years, they may well lack the domestic-market knowledge or relationships needed to apply them effectively. The solution&mdash;building a true domestic Chinese presence rather than an outpost&mdash;sounds obvious, but it&rsquo;s difficult to carry out without commitment from the top. Too many companies fail by using &ldquo;fly over&rdquo; management. But some multinationals appear to be investing the necessary resources; for example, we recently met (separately) with top executives of two big industrial companies who were being transferred from the West to run global R&amp;D organizations from Shanghai. The idea is to be closer to Chinese customers and the network of institutions and universities from which multinationals source talent.</p>
<h3 class="sm black">Retaining local talent</h3>
<p>China&rsquo;s universities graduate more than 10,000 science PhDs each year, and increasing numbers of Chinese scientists working overseas are returning home. Multinationals in particular are struggling to tap this inflow of researchers and managers. A recent survey by the executive-recruiting firm Heidrick &amp; Struggles found that 77 percent of the senior executives from multinational companies responding say they have difficulty attracting managers in China, while 91 percent regard employee turnover as their top talent challenge.</p>
<p>Retention is more of an issue for multinationals than for domestic companies, but as big foreign players raise their game, so must local ones. Chinese companies, for example, excel at creating a community-like environment to build loyalty to the institution. That helps keep some employees in place when competing offers arise, but it may not always be enough.</p>
<p>Talented Chinese employees increasingly recognize the benefits of being associated with a well-known foreign brand and like the mentorship and training that foreign companies can provide. So multinationals that commit themselves to developing meaningful career paths for Chinese employees should have a chance in the growing fight with their Chinese competitors for R&amp;D talent. Initiatives might include in-house training courses or apprenticeship programs, perhaps with local universities. General Motors sponsors projects in which professors and engineering departments at leading universities research issues of interest to the automaker. That helps it to develop closer relations with the institutions from which it recruits and to train students before they graduate.</p>
<p>Some multinationals energize Chinese engineers by shifting their roles from serving as capacity in a support of existing global programs to contributing significantly to new innovation thrusts, often aimed at the local market. This approach, increasingly common in the pharma industry, may hold lessons for other kinds of multinationals that have established R&amp;D or innovation centers in China in recent years (read about&nbsp;AstraZeneca&rsquo;s experience in &ldquo;Three snapshots of Chinese innovation&rdquo;). The keys to success include a clear objective&mdash; for instance, will activity support global programs or develop China-for-China innovations?&mdash;and a clear plan for attracting and retaining the talent needed to staff such centers. Too often, we visit impressive R&amp;D facilities, stocked with the latest equipment, that are almost empty because staffing them has proved difficult.</p>
<h3 class="sm black">Instilling a culture of risk taking</h3>
<p>Failure is a required element of innovation, but it isn&rsquo;t the norm in China, where a culture of obedience and adherence to rules prevails in most companies. Breaking or even bending them is not expected and rarely tolerated. To combat these attitudes, companies must find ways to make initiative taking more acceptable and better rewarded.</p>
<p>One approach we found, in a leading solar company, was to transfer risk from individual innovators to teams. Shared accountability and community support made increased risk taking and experimentation safer. The company has used these &ldquo;innovation work groups&rdquo; to develop everything from more efficient battery technology to new manufacturing processes. Team-based approaches also have proved effective for some multinationals trying to stimulate initiative taking (read about&nbsp;General Motors&rsquo; approach in &ldquo;Three snapshots of Chinese innovation&rdquo;).</p>
<p>How fast a culture of innovation takes off varies by industry. We see a much more rapid evolution toward the approach of Western companies in the way Chinese high-tech enterprises learn from their customers and how they apply that learning to create new products made for China (read a perspective on the&nbsp;evolution of its semiconductor sector in &ldquo;Thee snapshots of Chinese innovation&rdquo;). That approach is much less common at state-owned enterprises, since they are held back by hierarchical, benchmark-driven cultures.</p>
<h3 class="sm black">Promoting collaboration</h3>
<p>One area where multinationals currently have an edge is promoting collaboration and the internal collision of ideas, which can yield surprising new insights and business opportunities. In many Chinese companies, traditional organizational and cultural barriers inhibit such exchanges.</p>
<p>Although a lot of these companies have become more professional and adept at delivering products in large volumes, their ability to scale up an organization that can work collaboratively has not kept pace. Their rigorous, linear processes for bringing new products to market ensure rapid commercialization but create too many hand-offs where insights are lost and trade-offs for efficiency are promoted.</p>
<p>One Chinese consumer electronics company has repeatedly tried to improve the way it innovates. Senior management has called for new ideas and sponsored efforts to create new best-in-class processes, while junior engineers have designed high-quality prototypes. Yet the end result continues to be largely undifferentiated, incremental improvements. The biggest reason appears to be a lack of cross-company collaboration and a reliance on processes designed to build and reinforce scale in manufacturing. In effect, the technical and commercial sides of the business don&rsquo;t cooperate in a way that would allow some potentially winning ideas to reach the market. As Chinese organizations mature, stories like this one may become rarer.</p>
<div class="articleBreak"></div>
<p>China hasn&rsquo;t yet experienced a true innovation revolution. It will need time to evolve from a country of incremental innovation based on technology transfers to one where breakthrough innovation is common. The government will play a powerful role in that process, but ultimately it will be the actions of domestic companies and multinationals that dictate the pace of change&mdash;and determine who leads it.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Public-sector entities,</strong> like many commercial ones, are increasingly undertaking large transformation programs to streamline and improve their core operations. Nowhere is this task more challenging than in the US Department of Defense (DoD), which is committed to transforming its business practices to support faster and more agile operations. This multiyear mission will touch all aspects of the DoD, which has annual net operating costs exceeding $620 billion&mdash;including more than $30 billion for technology&mdash;2.9 million people, and a supply chain involving 5.2 million items.</p>
<p>[[exhibit exhibit 3]]</p>
<p>
In 2005, the DoD established the Business Transformation Agency (BTA) to help guide transformation efforts throughout the department. The BTA&rsquo;s responsibilities include deploying enterprise IT systems, publishing the Business Enterprise Architecture, and helping to carry out investment decisions. The agency, for example, oversees programs that manage pay and travel for the armed services, makes proposals to organizations such as the army and the navy (called &ldquo;components&rdquo; inside the Pentagon) about how they can transform themselves most effectively, and encourages standardization throughout the department.</p>

Few people have as good a position to reflect upon the DoD&rsquo;s transformation as David Fisher, the BTA&rsquo;s first official director. Fisher joined the DoD from Silicon Valley, where as a consultant he helped private-sector companies to implement large enterprise systems. As a special assistant to the deputy undersecretary of defense for financial management, Fisher helped guide an enterprise-level business transformation and served on the team that launched the BTA. McKinsey&rsquo;s James Kaplan and Kreg Nichols met with him in his office, in Arlington, Virginia, near Washington, DC, to discuss the differences between public- and private-sector transformations, as well as what he has learned about managing megaprojects.</p>

<p><strong>The <em>Quarterly</em>:</strong> Coming from Silicon Valley, how similar do you think the public and private sectors are?</p>
<p><strong>David Fisher:</strong> While the mission may be different, many of the business challenges are the same&mdash;for example, tracking supply chains or making certain that people are paid correctly and on time. But the public sector differs in some significant ways. For example, the scale is very different. The size and scope of the Department of Defense are challenging. The best way to think about our size is to take a look at our budget. In all, last year we had gross costs of over $600 billion, more than the sum of the revenues of, say, Wal-Mart, GE, and IBM. It&rsquo;s enormous, and there&rsquo;s nothing comparable to it in the private sector.</p>

<p>
Also, our leadership changes regularly&mdash;at least every eight years, when presidential administrations turn over, and generally more often. This is a challenge when you consider that huge organizations in the public and private sectors work at transformations for a long time, sometimes up to ten years, before really starting to reap the benefits. Paul Brinkley, the deputy undersecretary of defense for business transformation, reminds us that IBM was undergoing transformation for ten years before the company really started to reap the benefits of overhauling the supply chain, for example. Even in the best situations, transformations take a long time to accomplish. We look to commercial business for an indicative timeline, but you&rsquo;d have to combine four or five of the Fortune 10 to get the scale of the DoD.</p>

<p><strong>The <em>Quarterly</em>:</strong> What have you been able to use from your commercial-sector experience?</p>
<p><strong>David Fisher:</strong> My experience working with large companies helped prepare me for this type of role by giving me a willingness to buck the cultural trend and to suggest new ways of doing business. The BTA has been trying to apply the best practices from the commercial world, especially about how we govern and manage IT investments. If there are processes that we can streamline to help programs deliver capabilities faster, without getting bogged down in some of the administrative activities, we try to do that.</p>

<p>
This can be hard to do in a complex, hierarchical environment like the Department of Defense. Fortunately, many people around me, who have more experience within the government culture, have proved to be tremendously valuable at identifying constraints we face in public projects&mdash;constraints that just wouldn&rsquo;t be there in the private sector.</p>
<p>
The department has been trying to modernize the way it does business for a long time, and we still have a long way to go. Every administration tries, and I&rsquo;m sure we make some progress each time. But on the whole, we&rsquo;re not where we want to be&mdash;or where we need to be. We want to build on the good work that&rsquo;s been done before us, but we also need to question previous actions that weren&rsquo;t successful and to offer new solutions.</p>
<p><strong>The <em>Quarterly</em>:</strong> What are the goals of your transformation efforts?</p>
<p><strong>David Fisher:</strong> Our overall objective is to guide business transformation efforts at the enterprise level of the Department of Defense in order to improve the DoD&rsquo;s ability to perform its mission. We do that sometimes directly, sometimes indirectly. The BTA has a combination of operational and technical roles to play&mdash;for example, we manage the systems that handle travel and payroll for about 1.5 million employees of the DoD. But a big part of our role is to identify skill sets that are scattered throughout the DoD and unite them so that its components can work better together. For example, we bring the functional people and the technical people together so that a set of data standards affecting multiple areas can be agreed on.</p>
<p>
Successful coordination among the components doesn&rsquo;t come from exercising authority but rather from exerting influence. People in the components don&rsquo;t have to open the door to us, and I&rsquo;m not empowered to make them open the door. But if I can demonstrate value, they&rsquo;re going to open the door to me, whether I&rsquo;m empowered or not. It&rsquo;s all about adding value. There are certain things that we have authority for, but even in an environment where you have authority, your authority will only carry you so far in the effort to move things forward in a positive direction.</p>
<p><strong>The <em>Quarterly</em>:</strong> What are the main challenges in deploying technology to support the transformation?</p>
<p><strong>David Fisher:</strong> We spend about $2 billion each year on IT business transformation, half of it on enterprise resource planning systems throughout the Department of Defense. Much of the work for these ERP systems focuses on deciding what should be centralized, at the DoD enterprise level, and what should be managed by components&mdash;the military services, defense agencies, combatant commands, and military health services. As in any large organization, the people at the enterprise level are consumers of information. As long as information in different systems can be aggregated in a standard way, these people can do their jobs. On the other hand, some decision making is distributed, occurring within organizations that make up the DoD. The challenge lies in the gray area. Where is it more effective to have a single system at the center as opposed to multiple versions that adhere to common standards?</p>
<p>
[video Sample Chaptered video]
We have 27 systems in our enterprise portfolio today, and many of these are centralized only because the components did not have the ability to run their own when these systems were implemented years ago. As the capabilities of the components mature, we must ask if there are more efficient and effective ways to complete those transactions while still providing the members of our cross-component community with the information they need to do their jobs.</p>
<p><strong>The <em>Quarterly</em>:</strong> How do you manage such a large-scale transformation?</p>
<p><strong>David Fisher:</strong> Much depends on governance and on discipline in setting and implementing standards. Consider our experience implementing a set of standards for financial data. Initially, the reaction in the field was that this would cost too much to embed in individual IT systems, so we came up with a two-pronged approach.</p>
<p>
In the short term, we agreed to create a bridge system to the components&rsquo; legacy accounting systems, to save costs. It wasn&rsquo;t a perfect solution, but it moved us toward interoperable data at a relatively low cost in a short time frame. Our longer-term challenge involved integrating these standards into various ERP systems. It was critical to get this right, from the beginning. Again, the components&rsquo; managers were concerned that this would be expensive and difficult to integrate with their SAP and Oracle systems. So we deployed ERP experts among the components who worked with teams there to identify ways to configure the ERP systems so they could work with standardized data. It&rsquo;s been very successful.</p>
<p><strong>The <em>Quarterly</em>:</strong> How do you keep people motivated and set performance measures?</p>
<p><strong>David Fisher:</strong> When I left the commercial environment, I thought one of the great things about leaving was putting behind me the need to meet quarterly profit-and-loss targets and to deal with the short-term decision making that results from a quarterly focus. But now that I don&rsquo;t have those constraints, I miss having the motivation to hit quarterly numbers. So you have to look for different kinds of motivators to keep projects on time.</p>
<p>
The people who go into public service are unbelievably passionate about what they do. There is a tangible internal motivation about doing public service that is different from what you find in the commercial marketplace. It&rsquo;s not something you can necessarily put your finger on, but it&rsquo;s real. We appreciate that. It&rsquo;s very important. That said, we have to find ways to measure accountability. In the commercial world, there&rsquo;s the P&amp;L&mdash;you&rsquo;re held accountable for the numbers. We are always in search of ways to hold people accountable, not least because if you succeed at something, you want to be recognized for it.</p>
<p>
We and the rest of the Defense Department have recently begun to move away from an old tenure-based performance model to a new system&mdash;the National Security Personnel System&mdash;that is closer to pay for performance. This is the type of system that&rsquo;s familiar to commercial enterprises, but it&rsquo;s new to this public environment, so we had to spend some time explaining that the goals had to be objective, measurable, time constrained. It&rsquo;s been somewhat controversial because not everyone likes this shift. But as a manager, I have found it a positive shift, especially in terms of getting people to think about time. Sometimes, impatience is exactly right because within the public sector, things do tend to run on for a while. We need to build in that internal motivator that makes people ask, what did I get done today?</p>
<p>
In the end, however, while people care about their compensation, just as they should, it&rsquo;s a small part of what motivates people here. It&rsquo;s about the contribution to public service. One of the things that rallies the passion of these folks is seeing that they&rsquo;re making a difference on a national security&ndash;related issue that helps the people on the ground.</p>
<p><strong>The <em>Quarterly</em>:</strong> With such large-scale technology deployments, what have you learned about managing megaprojects?</p>
<p><strong>David Fisher:</strong> Many of the things that would portend a successful ERP implementation of small to medium size would portend success for the large programs at the DoD. We&rsquo;ve looked at the top reasons ERP implementations fail. Many failures come down to governance, change management, requirements management, customization, the skill sets of the people involved, and testing. Those concepts are immutable, regardless of size and scale. Our challenge with these immense projects is that implementation takes such a long time, spanning several generations of IT development. That can be problematic and leave an opportunity for endless analysis and debate.</p>
<p>
It&rsquo;s also important to clarify what we&rsquo;re trying to optimize, since one person&rsquo;s definition of the enterprise may be different from another&rsquo;s. From my perspective, the enterprise is the Department of Defense. But if I go to the army or navy, they might define the enterprise differently; if they&rsquo;re trying to optimize the army or navy as opposed to the DoD, we end up with different solutions.</p>
<p>
Let me give you one example of how the BTA&rsquo;s involvement helped the army reexamine the scope of some of its systems to good effect. The army had three big ERP systems&mdash;one that handled finance and two for logistics (a more tactical system for the front end and a more wholesale system for the back end). All three systems were operating fairly independently. Our observation was that, although these independent systems may be optimizing the parts, they were suboptimizing the whole in terms of business processes, management, and the utilization of technology.</p>
[video Sample Video]
<p>
Through some pretty heavy engagements&mdash;some well received, others not&mdash;we were able to demonstrate that there was a better way to use technology to reduce risks the army would face in the way the systems communicated, reconciled data, and otherwise performed together. We recommended that the army connect the three systems more closely because, for example, each of the logistics transactions was eventually going to be a financial transaction. If you look at things that way from the beginning, it fosters an environment where you look at the business from end to end. The army has now adopted some of those concepts and has a cross-domain governance model. So we got the conversation going and it&rsquo;s had this positive impact. We weren&rsquo;t empowered to do any of that by our authority. We were passionate about it, and we were able to convince the army to let us in on the dialogue and help them come to decisions that represented a change for the better.</p>
<p><strong>The <em>Quarterly</em>:</strong> Any other big lessons to pass along?</p>
<p><strong>David Fisher:</strong> Question every assumption. We often assume that we have to do something in a certain way because it&rsquo;s the policy or the way we&rsquo;ve done it before. Question that assumption, and if it doesn&rsquo;t make sense, find out who owns the policy or who owns the way it was done before. Even laws change. Sometimes the answer is no, and that&rsquo;s it. But if you have a case that helps everyone to agree that the old way doesn&rsquo;t make sense and that there&rsquo;s a better way, a transformational way, of doing things, question the old way.  </p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Musicians talk</strong> about being “in the groove,” sportsmen about being “in the zone.” Can employees in the workplace experience similar performance peaks and, if so, what can top management do to encourage the mental state that brings them about?</p><p>
We’ve long been interested in work environments that inspire exceptional levels of energy, increase self-confidence, and boost individual productivity. When we ask leaders about the ingredient they think is most often missing for them and for their colleagues—and by implication is most difficult to provide—they almost invariably signal the same thing: a strong sense of meaning. By “meaning,” we and they imply a feeling that what’s happening really matters, that what’s being done has not been done before or that it will make a difference to others.</p><p>
The idea of meaning at work is not new. Indeed, two contributions to <i>McKinsey Quarterly</i><a class='link-footnote' rel='#footnote1' href='#' onclick='return false;'><sup>1</sup></a> <span id='footnote1' class='tooltip' style='display:none;'><span class='footnote-content'><span class='footnote-number'>1.</span><span class='footnote-text'>
See Teresa Amabile and Steven Kramer, “<a href='http://www.mckinseyquarterly.com/article_page.aspx?ar=2910'>How leaders kill meaning at work</a>,” mckinseyquarterly.com, January 2012; and Cynthia A. Montgomery, “<a href='http://www.mckinseyquarterly.com/article_page.aspx?ar=2993'>How strategists lead</a>,” mckinseyquarterly.com, July 2012.
</span><span class='clear'></span> </span><span class='footnote-bottom'></span></span> over the past year have highlighted this theme. In one, the authors demonstrate how misguided leaders often kill meaning in avoidable ways. The author of the other suggests that “meaning maker” is a critical role for corporate strategists. In this article, we will show from our research how meaning drives higher workplace productivity and explain what business leaders can do to create meaning.</p><!--roadblock--><h3>Meaning and performance</h3><p>
The mental state that gives rise to great performance—in sports, business, or the arts—has been described in different ways. The psychologist Mihàly Csìkszentmihàlyi studied thousands of subjects, from sculptors to factory workers, and asked them to record their feelings at intervals throughout the working day. Csìkszentmihàlyi came up with a concept we consider helpful. He observed that people fully employing their core capabilities to meet a goal or challenge created what he called “flow.” More important, he found that individuals who frequently experienced it were more productive and derived greater satisfaction from their work than those who didn’t. They set goals for themselves to increase their capabilities, thereby tapping into a seemingly limitless well of energy. And they expressed a willingness to repeat those activities in which they achieved flow even if they were not being paid to do so.</p><p>
Athletes describe the same feeling as being in the zone. Bill Russell, a key player for the Boston Celtics during the period when they won 11 professional-basketball championships in 13 years, put it thus: “When it happened, I could feel my play rise to a new level. . . . It would surround not only me and the other Celtics, but also the players on the other team. . . . At that special level, all sorts of odd things happened. The game would be in the white heat of competition, and yet somehow I wouldn’t feel competitive. . . . I’d be putting out the maximum effort . . . and yet I never felt the pain.”<a class='link-footnote' rel='#footnote2' href='#' onclick='return false;'><sup>2</sup></a> <span id='footnote2' class='tooltip' style='display:none;'><span class='footnote-content'><span class='footnote-number'>2.</span><span class='footnote-text'>

</span><span class='clear'></span> </span><span class='footnote-bottom'></span></span></p><p>
Flow sounds great in theory, but few business leaders have mastered the skill of generating it reliably in the workplace. An easy first step is to consider what creates flow in your own work situation—a question we have put directly to more than 5,000 executives during workshops we’ve conducted over the last decade. In this exercise, individuals initially think about their own personal peak performance with a team, when, in other words, they have come closest to the feelings Csìkszentmihàlyi and Russell describe. Then they pinpoint the conditions that made this level of performance possible: what in the team environment was there more or less of than usual?</p><p>
The remarkably consistent answers we’ve received fall into three categories. The first set includes elements such as role clarity, a clear understanding of objectives, and access to the knowledge and resources needed to get the job done. These are what one might term rational elements of a flow experience or, to use a convenient shorthand, its intellectual quotient (IQ). When the IQ of a work environment is low, the energy employees bring to the workplace is misdirected and often conflicting.</p><p>
Another set of answers includes factors related to the quality of the interactions among those involved. Here, respondents often mention a baseline of trust and respect, constructive conflict, a sense of humor, a general feeling that “we’re in this together,” and the corresponding ability to collaborate effectively. These create an emotionally safe environment to pursue challenging goals or, to borrow from the writings of Daniel Goleman and others, an environment with a high emotional quotient (EQ). When the EQ of a workplace is lacking, employee energy dissipates in the form of office politics, ego management, and passive-aggressive avoidance of tough issues.</p><p>
While IQ and EQ are absolutely necessary to create the conditions for peak performance, they are far from sufficient. The longest list of words we have compiled from executives’ answers to our peak-performance question over the last ten years has little to do with either of these categories. This third one describes the peak-performance experience as involving high stakes; excitement; a challenge; and something that the individual feels matters, will make a difference, and hasn’t been done before. We describe this third category as the meaning quotient (MQ) of work. When a business environment’s MQ is low, employees put less energy into their work and see it as “just a job” that gives them little more than a paycheck.</p><p>
The opportunity cost of the missing meaning is enormous. When we ask executives during the peak-performance exercise how much more productive they were at their peak than they were on average, for example, we get a range of answers, but the most common at senior levels is an increase of five times. Most report that they and their employees are in the zone at work less than 10 percent of the time, though some claim to experience these feelings as much as 50 percent of it. If employees working in a high-IQ, high-EQ, and high-MQ environment are five times more productive at their peak than they are on average, consider what even a relatively modest 20-percentage-point increase in peak time would yield in overall workplace productivity—it would almost double.</p><p>
What’s more, when we ask executives to locate the bottlenecks to peak performance in their organizations, more than 90 percent choose MQ-related issues. They point out that much of the IQ tool kit is readily observable and central to what’s taught in business schools. The EQ tool kit, while “softer,” is now relatively well understood following Goleman’s popularization of the concept in the mid-1990s. The MQ tool kit is different.</p><h3>What to do differently</h3><p>
Business leaders, we know from other sources, are striving hard to find the missing MQ ingredients so they can improve motivation and workforce productivity. Late last year, for example, a survey (conducted by The Conference Board and McKinsey) of more than 500 US-based HR executives identified employee engagement as one of the top five critical human-capital priorities facing organizations.<a class='link-footnote' rel='#footnote3' href='#' onclick='return false;'><sup>3</sup></a> <span id='footnote3' class='tooltip' style='display:none;'><span class='footnote-content'><span class='footnote-number'>3.</span><span class='footnote-text'>

</span><span class='clear'></span> </span><span class='footnote-bottom'></span></span></p><p>
Management thinkers are also on the case. Gary Hamel urges modern managers to see themselves as “entrepreneurs of meaning.” In <i>The Progress Principle</i>, Harvard Business School professor Teresa Amabile and her coauthor Steve Kramer present rigorous field research highlighting the enormous benefits that a sense of forward momentum can have for employees’ “inner work life.”<a class='link-footnote' rel='#footnote4' href='#' onclick='return false;'><sup>4</sup></a> <span id='footnote4' class='tooltip' style='display:none;'><span class='footnote-content'><span class='footnote-number'>4.</span><span class='footnote-text'>

In our experience, though, there’s often a disconnect between the desire of practitioners to create meaning in the workplace, the good ideas emerging from cutting-edge research, and the number of specific, practical, and reliable tools that leaders know how to use. Often, platitudes about communication, quality feedback, job flexibility, and empowerment are used as substitutes for such tools. Much of this amounts to little more than advice about how to be a good manager. Inspirational visions, along the lines of Walt Disney’s “make people happy” or Google’s “organize the world’s information,” have little relevance if you produce ball bearings or garage doors.</p><p>
In McKinsey’s research, we’ve uncovered a set of specific, actionable techniques underpinned both by experience and a significant body of social-science work. The full tool kit can be found in <i>Beyond Performance: How Great Organizations Build Ultimate Competitive Advantage</i>.<a class='link-footnote' rel='#footnote6' href='#' onclick='return false;'><sup>6</sup></a> <span id='footnote6' class='tooltip' style='display:none;'><span class='footnote-content'><span class='footnote-number'>6.</span><span class='footnote-text'>
Scott Keller and Colin Price, <i>Beyond Performance: How Great Organizations Build Ultimate Competitive Advantage</i>, first edition, Hoboken, NJ: John Wiley & Sons, 2011.
</span><span class='clear'></span> </span><span class='footnote-bottom'></span></span> The three examples described here are not only among the most counterintuitive (and therefore the most often overlooked) but also the most powerful.</p><h3 class="sm black">Strategy #1: Tell five stories at once</h3><p>We typically see organizational leaders tell two types of stories to inspire their teams. The first, the turnaround story, runs along the lines of “We’re performing below industry standard and must change dramatically to survive—incremental change is not sufficient to attract investors to our underperforming company.” The second, the good-to-great story, goes something like this: “We are capable of far more, given our assets, market position, skills, and loyal staff, and can become the undisputed leader in our industry for the foreseeable future.”</p><p>
The problem with both approaches is that the story centers on the company, and that will inspire some but by no means all employees. Our research shows that four other sources give individuals a sense of meaning, including their ability to have an impact on</p><ul class="leftContentUL"><li><p>society—for example, making a better society, building the community, or stewarding resources</p></li><li><p>the customer—for instance, making life easier and providing a superior service or product</p></li><li><p>the working team—for instance, a sense of belonging, a caring environment, or working together efficiently and effectively</p></li><li><p>themselves—examples include personal development, a higher paycheck or bonus, and a sense of empowerment</p></li></ul><p>
Surveys of hundreds of thousands of employees show that the split in most companies—regardless of management level, industry sector, or geography (developed or developing economies)—is roughly equal. It appears that these five sources are a universal human phenomenon.</p><p>
The implication for leaders seeking to create high-MQ environments is that a turnaround or a good-to-great story will strike a motivational chord with only 20 percent of the workforce. The same goes for a “change the world” vision like those of Disney and Google or appeals to individuals on a personal level. The way to unleash MQ-related organizational energy is to tell all five stories at once.</p><p>
A recent cost-reduction program at a large US financial-services company began with a rational-change story focused on the facts: expenses were growing faster than revenues. Three months into the program, it was clear that employee resistance was stymieing progress. The management team therefore worked together to recast the story to include elements related to society (more affordable housing), customers (increased simplicity and flexibility, fewer errors, more competitive prices), working teams (less duplication, more delegation, increased accountability, a faster pace), and individuals (bigger and more attractive jobs, a once-in-a-career opportunity to build turnaround skills, a great opportunity to “make your own” institution). The program was still <i>what</i> it was—a cost-reduction program—but the reasons it mattered were cast in far more meaningful terms.</p><p>
Within a month, the share of employees reporting that they were motivated to drive the change program forward jumped to 57 percent, from 35 percent, according to the company’s employee-morale pulse surveys. The program went on to exceed initial expectations, raising efficiency by 10 percent in the first year.</p><h3 class="sm black">Strategy #2: Let employees ‘write their own lottery ticket’</h3><p>The first strategy gives specific and practical guidance about how to <i>tell</i> the story. Yet the best meaning makers spend more time <i>asking</i> than telling.</p><p>
In one of Daniel Kahneman’s famous experiments, researchers ran a lottery with a twist. Half of the participants were randomly assigned a lottery ticket. The remaining half were given a blank piece of paper and asked to write down any number they pleased. Just before drawing the winning number, the researchers offered to buy back the tickets from their holders. The question they wanted to answer was how much more would you have to pay people who “wrote their own number” than people who received a number randomly. The rational answer should be no difference at all, since a lottery is pure chance, and therefore every ticket number, chosen or assigned, has the same odds of winning. A completely rational actor might even want to pay less for a freely chosen number, given the possibility of duplicate ones. The actual answer? Regardless of geography or demographics, researchers found they had to pay at least five times more to those who chose their own number.</p><p>
This result reveals a truth about human nature: when we choose for ourselves, we are far more committed to the outcome—by a factor of at least five to one.</p><p>
In business, of course, leaders can’t just let everyone decide their own direction. But they can still apply the lessons of the lottery-ticket experiment. The head of financial services at one global bank we know first wrote down his change story, shared it with his team for feedback, and then in effect asked all individual team members to write their own lottery ticket: what change story, in each of the businesses, supported the wider message? His team members in turn wrote change stories, shared them with <i>their</i> teams, and the process continued all the way to the front line. Although this method took far longer than the traditional road-show approach, the return on commitment to the program was considered well worth the investment and an important reason the bank achieved roughly two times its revenue-per-banker-improvement targets.</p><p>
Likewise, when Neville Isdell took charge at Coca-Cola, in 2004, he cocreated a turnaround strategy by bringing together his top 150 employees for three multiday “real work” sessions. The process was then cascaded further down into the organization, at small working meetings where participants could in effect write their own lottery ticket about the implications for their particular parts of the business. With hindsight, this process of creating and interactively cascading what became known as The Manifesto for Growth is seen as a pivotal intervention in a two-year turnaround in which the group stopped destroying shareholder value and generated returns of 20 percent, driven by volume increases equivalent to selling an extra 105 million bottles of Coke a day. In this period, staff turnover fell by 25 percent, and the company reported what external researchers called unprecedented increases in employee engagement for an organization of this size.</p><p>
Leaders who need to give their employees more of a sense of direction can still leverage the lottery-ticket insight by augmenting their telling of the story with asking about the story. David Farr, chairman and CEO of Emerson Electric, for example, is known for asking virtually everyone he encounters in the organization four questions: (1) how do you make a difference? (testing for alignment with the company’s direction); (2) what improvement idea are you working on? (emphasizing continuous improvement); (3) when did you last get coaching from your boss? (emphasizing the importance of people development); and (4) who is the enemy? (emphasizing the importance of “One Emerson” and no silos, as well as directing the staff’s energy toward the external threat). The motivational effect of this approach has been widely noted by Emerson employees.</p><h3 class="sm black">Strategy #3: Use small, unexpected rewards to motivate</h3><p>US author Upton Sinclair once wrote, “It is difficult to get a man to understand something when his salary depends upon his not understanding it.” The flip side, however, isn’t true. When business objectives are linked to compensation, the motivation to drive for results is rarely enhanced meaningfully.</p><p>
The reason is as practical as psychological. Most annual-compensation plans of executives are so full of key performance indicators that the weighting of any one objective becomes largely meaningless in the grand scheme of things. Furthermore, most compensation plans typically emphasize financial metrics whose results depend on myriad variables, many beyond individual control. On top of that, most companies don’t have deep enough pockets to make compensation a significant driver of MQ in the workplace.</p><p>
Leaders of organizations that successfully instill meaning understand the power of other methods. Terry Burnham and Jay Phelan’s book, <i>Mean Genes</i>,<a class='link-footnote' rel='#footnote7' href='#' onclick='return false;'><sup>7</sup></a> <span id='footnote7' class='tooltip' style='display:none;'><span class='footnote-content'><span class='footnote-number'>7.</span><span class='footnote-text'> Terry Burnham and Jay Phelan, <i>Mean Genes: From Sex to Money to Food: Taming Our Primal Instincts</i>, first edition, New York, NY: Perseus Publishing, 2000. 
</span><span class='clear'></span> </span><span class='footnote-bottom'></span></span> describes an experiment in which 50 percent of a group of people using a photocopier found a dime in the coin-return slot. When all were asked to rate their satisfaction level, those who got the dime scored an average of 6.5 on a scale of 1 to 7, while those who didn’t scored just 5.6. The lesson here is that when we aren’t expecting a reward, even a small one can have a disproportionate effect on our state of mind. And that’s also true of employees in the workplace.</p><p>
At ANZ Bank, John McFarlane gave all employees a bottle of champagne for Christmas, with a card thanking them for their work on a major change program. The CEO of Wells Fargo, John Stumpf, marked the first anniversary of its change program by sending out personal thank-you notes to all the employees who had been involved, with specific messages related to the impact of their individual work. Indra Nooyi, CEO of PepsiCo, sends the spouses of her top team handwritten thank-you letters. After seeing the impact of her own success on her mother during a visit to India, she began sending letters to the parents of her top team, too.</p><p>
Some managers might dismiss these as token gestures—but employees often tell us that the resulting boost in motivation and in connection to the leader and the company can last for months if not years. As Sam Walton, founder of Wal-Mart Stores, put it, “Nothing else can quite substitute for a few well-chosen, well-timed, sincere words of praise. They’re absolutely free—and worth a fortune.”</p><div class="articleBreak"></div><p>Of the three Qs that characterize a workplace likely to generate flow and inspire peak performance, we frequently hear from business leaders that MQ is the hardest to get right. Given the size of the prize for injecting meaning into people’s work lives, taking the time to implement strategies of the kind described here is surely among the most important investments a leader can make.<br /></p><div class="about-authors"><h3 class="sm black">About the authors</h3><p><b>Susie Cranston</b> is a senior expert in McKinsey’s San Francisco office, and <b>Scott Keller</b> is a director in the Southern California office.</p></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>
<strong>The rising tide</strong> of regulatory scrutiny stemming from the global financial crisis has now reached beyond banks, to the companies that supply them. Under the broad notion that activities can be outsourced, but responsibility can&rsquo;t, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) and other regulators are holding financial institutions responsible not only for their own actions but also for those of their vendors and suppliers. In the past year, for example, American Express, Capital One, and Discover Bank have paid a total of more than $530 million to settle complaints of deceptive selling and predatory behavior by their third-party suppliers.</p>
<p>
This new regulatory thrust poses a big challenge for financial institutions because some of them have a limited perspective on their suppliers&rsquo; interactions with customers. The largest banks and credit-card companies can have close to 50,000 suppliers. They are quite careful about some of these relationships and often have teams to manage large and midsize suppliers. Of course, many vendors provide paper, computers, and other innocuous goods and services. But a significant number of vendor relationships are not closely managed, and some carry hidden risks. A company that molds and prints credit cards, for example, is entrusted with customer data, and that poses any number of privacy and security risks.</p>
<p>
At many institutions, vendor-management programs have focused predominantly on risks to the bank and the financial system&mdash;specifically, on business continuity, financial strength, and credit risk. With the scope of regulatory oversight broadening to include the consumer, many firms are underprepared. But since financial institutions must bear the responsibility for their suppliers&rsquo; misdeeds, they must improve the way they manage these relationships.</p>
<p>
In response to the changes, financial firms are looking for new solutions to identify and manage third-party risk. A number of leading banks and credit-card companies are developing and embracing best practices. Our research and experience have helped us develop a comprehensive approach to managing third-party risk. It consists of six essential steps, some of which can be executed in parallel.</p>
<h3>1. A comprehensive inventory of third parties</h3>
<p>
Regulators now expect institutions to know their third parties, how each of them interacts with consumers, and what activities it performs. Many firms do not have this information readily available. Supplier databases can be incomplete, and some of the most sensitive risks can reside in relationships that are not found in them. Cobranded partnerships, joint ventures, sponsorships, and similar relationships can account for up to 80 percent of the spending that some business units assign to suppliers. But these relationships are often managed in ways that emphasize commercial goals, with only a secondary focus on risk. What&rsquo;s more, in some firms individual business units have different ways of tracking their suppliers, making it difficult to compare and collate them across an entire organization.</p>
<p>
In our experience, an effective database of third parties includes all of them&mdash;that is, any noncustomer entity with which a financial institution has a business relationship. An enterprise-wide survey is a good way to get started.</p>
<h3>2. A comprehensive catalog of third-party risks</h3>
<p>
To monitor consumer risk successfully, firms must develop a comprehensive catalog of these risks, also known as breakpoints, which form the basis for scorecards, audit routines, and other monitoring activities. Consider one breakpoint for a third-party call center: if there is a risk that agents will misrepresent product information to customers, a bank may investigate this specific problem by having calls monitored and may request regular reports on their quality and on customer-escalation metrics (exhibit). Identifying the relevant breakpoints for each category of suppliers and determining the relative weight and importance of every breakpoint can be challenging. Building a master register of breakpoints and their associated risk weights for all of these categories can help. Although broadly relevant to most firms, the master register can be adapted to the particular circumstances of an individual organization and its unique third-party relationships. This process is essential, as it helps the firm identify the true drivers of its risks and guides its mitigation program.</p>

    <div id="v3">
      
      
      <p>To mitigate risk, companies should tailor oversight to specific breakpoints.</p>

    </div>
    
<h3>3. A risk-based segmentation</h3>
<p>
Once a firm has a complete inventory of third-party suppliers and the risks they pose to customers, it can segment its suppliers by risk level. Even a simple system of high-, medium-, and low-risk categories can be useful. We have observed that most leading institutions have 200 to 300 high-risk relationships at a time, irrespective of the total number of third parties with which they contract. An effective segmentation can help a firm determine how to utilize its resources strategically. It may, for example, conduct additional due diligence on high-risk relationships and automate regular reviews of low-risk suppliers.</p>
<p>
In our experience, firms typically use either of two approaches to segment third-party suppliers. Companies that follow the score-based approach conduct due diligence across all dimensions and use the results to develop a composite risk score. Although very thorough, this approach can be onerous and resource intensive for many organizations. Using the rules-based approach, a firm identifies specific rules or criteria for each segment and thereby streamlines the process of assigning suppliers to risk categories. In fact, this approach is about 40 to 60 percent faster than the score-based one. Given the importance of an approach to segmentation, leading institutions tend to invest heavily in designing it. Typically, they appoint a core team of risk experts to lead the design, the fine-tuning, and the implementation.</p>
<h3>4. A rules-based due-diligence test</h3>
<p>
Today, firms are expected to expand their due-diligence efforts beyond the traditional assessments for supplier, operational, and IT-security risks. Regulators are increasingly sensitive to strategic and reputational risks that third parties can create for customers. Traditional approaches align specific due-diligence activities with the risk category identified by the risk-based segmentation; a supplier in the high-risk category is subject to all due-diligence investigations. Like the score-based segmentation approach, this one can be overly onerous and resource intensive. Here too the rules-based approach can be a better answer because it triggers an appropriate set of due-diligence activities for the risks identified. For example, even if a third party is deemed to pose a high risk, an information-security or data-privacy screening is unnecessary if the supplier does not hold information that personally identifies customers. We estimate that the rules-based approach can cut employee time by close to 40 percent.   </p>
<h3>5. A disciplined governance and escalation process</h3>
<p>
Organizational alignment is particularly important when decision-making rights are spread across a range of businesses and functions, such as procurement, compliance, and operational-risk management. By proactively establishing governance structures and processes to address misalignments, institutions can resolve challenges quickly.</p>
<p>
Governance can be centralized or decentralized; both models (and some hybrids) can be successful. In the centralized model, most major risk decisions reside within a single group, such as procurement or shared services. While the centralized model identifies a clear and accountable &ldquo;owner,&rdquo; it can sometimes lead to tension between the business unit that has a working relationship with a third party and the centralized body accountable for risk assessments.</p>
<p>
In the decentralized model, the business unit that owns the relationship also manages the risk. This arrangement can sometimes result in a duplication of resources: several business units may, for example, assess a major third-party supplier for similar contracts. In some cases, the application and alignment of risk standards can be inconsistent in a decentralized model: the groups managing, say, procurement and operational risk could have different perspectives. A hybrid approach, carefully tailored to the organizational context, can help mitigate challenges associated with the two models as long as risk ownership is clear.</p>
<p>
An escalation framework is critical to resolve issues&mdash;such as requests for exceptions and the resolution of third-party breaches&mdash;that exceed the decision-making limits set out in the governance structure. While most organizations have an operational-risk management group, its governance model and mandate might not be sufficient to address the additional volume of third-party issues. In our experience, leading financial institutions often choose to assign new responsibilities to standing committees rather than create new ones to support third-party escalations. Each organization must find an appropriate approach given its appetite for risk and its culture.</p>
<h3>6. An integrated management-reporting and workflow process and tools</h3>
<p>
Clear, actionable management reports and well-designed workflow systems are essential for accountability across the business units, compliance, and audit. To work well, these tools must track and monitor the relevant data. More important, they must aid the workflow within and across business units and give managers a clear picture of real-time risk, with actionable recommendations. In our experience, most organizations currently have tools that address one or two of these functional needs, but to our knowledge none has a single tool that performs all three.</p>
<p>
Building a new third-party risk application from scratch is a big undertaking; so too is enhancing a current risk tool to perform new functions. Some firms have turned to off-the-shelf workflow- and risk-management tools that can easily be customized to an organization&rsquo;s specific needs.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>To fully grasp</strong> China’s future direction, it is essential to understand its new middle class. A huge wave of increasingly affluent consumers will constitute China’s urban majority in less than a decade. The rapid emergence of this prosperous, digitally savvy, individualistic, and sophisticated class of consumers is creating opportunities and challenges for the companies that serve them. This slideshow looks at this consumer and urbanization phenomenon by the numbers. To understand, for example, how Singles Day—China’s alternative to Valentine’s Day—dwarfs Cyber Monday in the United States in online sales revenue, look inside.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Africa is the world&rsquo;s second-fastest-growing region. Poverty is falling, and around 90 million of its households have joined the world&rsquo;s consuming classes&mdash;an increase of 31 million in just over a decade. But a new McKinsey Global Institute report, <em>Africa at work: Job creation and inclusive growth</em>, shows that the continent must create wage-paying jobs more quickly to sustain these successes and ensure that growth benefits the majority of its people. </p>
<p>Despite the creation of 37 million new and stable wage-paying jobs over the past decade, only 28 percent of Africa&rsquo;s labor force holds such positions. Instead, some 63 percent of the total labor force engages in some form of self-employment or &ldquo;vulnerable&rdquo; employment, such as subsistence farming or urban street hawking. If the trends of the past decade continue, Africa will create 54 million new, stable wage-paying jobs over the next ten years&mdash;but this will not be enough to absorb the 122 million new entrants into the labor force expected over the same period. However, by implementing a five-part strategy to accelerate the pace of job creation, we estimate that Africa could add as many as 72 million new wage-paying jobs over the next decade, raising the wage-earning share of the labor force to 36 percent. </p>

<p><span class="mck_h3_sm"><h3>1. Identify one or more labor-intensive subsectors in which an African country has a global competitive advantage or could fill strong domestic demand.</span> Lesotho, for example, capitalized on the African Growth and Opportunity Act (2000), granting some African exports duty-free access to US markets. A landlocked nation surrounded entirely by South Africa, Lesotho developed industrial zones for the apparel industry and built rail links between them, offered incentives to foreign investors, and simplified the regulation of the sector. Today, Lesotho&rsquo;s apparel exports to the United States are almost 100 times as large as South Africa&rsquo;s on a per capita basis, and the sector is the single largest creator of jobs, employing about 40,000 people in 2008 in a country of just two million. </h3></span>
<p><span class="mck_h3_sm"><h3>2. Improve access to finance in target sectors. Cape Verde, for instance, encouraged foreign direct investment to ease financial constraints on its tourism sector.</span> To capitalize on the country&rsquo;s beautiful beaches, it offered investors a five-year tax holiday, exemption from import duties, and unrestricted expatriation of profits. Revenues generated by foreign tourism increased from $23 million in 1999 to $542 million in 2008, and the sector now employs 21 percent of Cape Verde&rsquo;s workforce. </h3></span>
<p><span class="mck_h3_sm"><h3>3. Build a suitable infrastructure. Countries that remove infrastructure constraints in target subsectors, particularly in export-oriented industries, can reap sizable benefits.</span> Mali&rsquo;s exports of mangoes to the European Union, for example, grew sixfold between 2003 and 2008 after a concerted public&ndash;private program helped the country build integrated road, rail, and other infrastructure necessary to access export markets. These moves cut the transit time for shipments in half. </h3></span>
<p><span class="mck_h3_sm"><h3>4. Cut unnecessary regulations. Removing needless red tape in certain sectors is also important.</span> In Rwanda, for instance, streamlining the procedures needed to open a business dramatically increased the number of new companies, from only 700 a year before the reform to 3,000 a year today. </h3></span>
<p><span class="mck_h3_sm"><h3>5. Develop skills in target sectors. Around 40 percent of African workers now have at least some secondary education, and that share will rise to 48 percent by 2020.</span> Few employers in our survey of businesses in Egypt, Kenya, Nigeria, Senegal, and South Africa reported that a lack of skilled workers was a top barrier to growth. Still, Africa&rsquo;s educational attainment lags behind that of other regions, and the continent would undoubtedly benefit from continued improvement. Two things are of particular importance: work readiness among school graduates and, in some countries, specific vocational skills. </h3></span>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Gross corruption,</strong> constant wars, and irrational economics long made Africa a poor, troubled continent where natural-resource companies were almost the only multinationals that dared or cared to do business. But in the 1990s, the picture improved. The wars started subsiding. Many governments balanced their budgets and created a better, safer environment for companies, both foreign and domestic. And the African consumer began to stir. Now 80 million households earn at least the equivalent of $5,000 annually, the point where discretionary spending commences&mdash;an increase of 80 percent in eight years. Meanwhile, the continent&rsquo;s GDP has been rising steadily, at around 5 percent a year, for the past decade, reaching $1.6 trillion in 2008. Last year, Africa was one of just two regions (the other was Asia) where GDP rose. </p>
<p>Is all this good news sustainable? At the 2010 Fortune Global Forum, in Cape Town, South Africa, McKinsey Publishing&rsquo;s Rik Kirkland spoke with Absa&rsquo;s Maria Ramos, Coca-Cola&rsquo;s Bill Egbe, and McKinsey&rsquo;s Norbert D&ouml;rr to find the answer.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>An appreciating yen</strong> and a stagnant domestic market make global expansion a logical move for Japanese companies with bold growth aspirations. Indeed, Japanese companies are making international forays, albeit quietly: it is a little-reported fact that the number of outbound M&A deals in Japan has been on an upward trajectory in recent years. If the trend continues, Japanese cross-border M&A activity will soon surpass its 1990 peak. </p><p>
Deal levels would be even higher if Japanese companies were not haunted by past M&A failures. Pitfalls abound along the road to international M&A, and although some of them are now well-known and thus studiously circumvented, others—particularly those having to do with fundamental differences in business and management culture—seem almost impossible for Japanese companies to avoid. Retaining foreign talent presents a particular challenge. </p><p>
To gain insights into how Japanese companies should manage international acquisitions, we interviewed non-Japanese executives whose companies have been acquired by Japanese companies in large cross-border M&A deals within the past decade. We also conducted in-depth outside-in analyses on a handful of deals in which Japanese companies—such as Hitachi Construction Machinery, Suzuki Motors, Takeda Pharmaceuticals, and Toshiba—were able to boost international sales through cross-border M&A.<a class='link-footnote' rel='#footnote1' href='#' onclick='return false;'><sup>1</sup></a> <span id='footnote1' class='tooltip' style='display:none;'><span class='footnote-content'><span class='footnote-number'>1.</span><span class='footnote-text'>
We focused on deals in which the acquirer sought partial integration (neither full autonomy for the subsidiary nor a complete merger) since this is a common model applied by Japanese companies, many of which do not have the confidence to fully integrate an overseas entity.
</span><span class='clear'></span> </span><span class='footnote-bottom'></span></span></p><p>
Our findings indicate that there is no silver-bullet approach to capturing the greatest value from an international acquisition. Companies have had success using a variety of approaches, each tailored to the acquirer’s strategic intentions, its unique characteristics, and the dynamics of the industry. Although a company’s particular industry, context, and objectives should dictate the specific tactics it uses, the approaches we studied can give acquirers a starting point to consider—whether that starting point entails focusing on one such tactic or emulating all of them. </p><!--roadblock--><h3>Perspectives of the acquired</h3><p>
Most Japanese executives who have played the global M&A game are familiar with the most common obstacles: disagreement between the acquirer and the acquired over how much value ought to be captured immediately after the deal closes or the positioning of the new subsidiary within the parent company, assumptions by Japanese leaders that what works for their company must also work elsewhere, inattention to the acquired company’s employees, and a lack of postacquisition-management leadership and skills. </p><p>
What may be less familiar—and even surprising—to them are the observations of executives at US and European companies that have been acquired by Japanese companies. Interviews with executives from six such companies of various sizes (from $200 million to $1 billion in value) indicate a number of stumbling blocks. The first four, in particular, are detrimental to talent retention; they are the main reasons that non-Japanese executives do not stay long at such companies. </p><p><strong>A hands-off approach.</strong> Although Japanese executives may think the acquired company would prefer to be left alone—and although the parent company’s restraint may at first appear admirable and wise—many foreign executives come to feel that this is the wrong approach. One major benefit of being acquired, they say, should be that the subsidiary can fully leverage the capabilities of its parent company. Foreign executives want the acquirer to engage with its new subsidiary and jointly tackle issues as they arise. </p><p><strong>An ambiguous power structure.</strong> Non-Japanese executives have difficulty determining where the true power lies within a Japanese organization. For example, the deal executive in an M&A situation could have a lofty title (such as senior managing director). The target company might therefore focus on building a relationship with this person, continue to interact with him after the acquisition, and belatedly discover that he actually has no direct reports and no influence over day- to-day business. In one case, the deal executive was kept on staff only because he was a favorite of the former CEO. </p><p><strong>The tyranny of the middle.</strong> Our interviewees said that middle managers at the parent company can be destructive forces: they derive power from their proximity to the Japanese CEO and try to control information. A common example: if the acquired company requests additional capital investment for growth, middle managers may choose not to raise this request to the CEO. When the leaders of the acquired company follow up with the CEO a few months later, they learn that the CEO was never informed of the request. Incidents such as this can cause middle management to lose the respect of line leaders at the acquired company. </p><p><strong>The glass ceiling for foreigners.</strong> Japanese companies often have an insular culture. The general assumption is that a foreigner can rise only so high in the organization. Foreign executives thus consider leaving not because of unsatisfactory compensation but because they feel their careers are unfairly capped. </p><p><strong>Detail orientation.</strong> American and European executives have difficulty understanding Japanese attention to detail. A Japanese company’s due-diligence checklist, for example, is typically three times longer than that of an acquisition-savvy Western company, in part due to Japanese companies’ risk aversion. In a postacquisition setting, a Japanese company would want to understand, for instance, the discrepancy between a sales forecast and actual sales. It could very well decide to investigate assumptions made a year ago, whereas a Western company would care only about the actual sales figure and how to improve it. </p><p><strong>Poor postacquisition planning.</strong> Attention to detail notwithstanding, Japanese companies tend to be laissez-faire about what happens immediately after a deal closes. They do not see value in creating a concrete architecture in the interim to ensure a successful transition. Foreign executives often lament that transition governance and interim processes for decision making, resource allocation, and escalation of business-critical issues are insufficiently discussed. </p><p><strong>Sudden metamorphosis from friendly partner to distant boss.</strong> Our interviewees reported several experiences in which the initial integration phase was friendly and collaborative, then abruptly morphed into an intense discussion about steep cost reduction. Although this happens in non-Japanese settings as well, it is particularly pronounced in Japanese M&A because Japanese buyers can be extremely polite—to a point that foreigners sometimes find misleading. In one case, even though the acquirer had already decided to eliminate the target company’s research department, executives still made multiple visits to the target’s research sites to keep up appearances. When employees at the target company learned that the decision was made months ago, their trust in the parent company crumbled. </p><h3>Four approaches</h3><p>
To find out how Japanese companies have addressed one or more of these pitfalls, we examined the approach of the very small number of companies—14, to be exact—that completed at least five acquisitions during the past decade and generate more than half their revenues from overseas markets. In each of the deals we examined, the acquirer used a different postacquisition approach depending on the focus of the change program (exhibit). The approaches are not mutually exclusive. A company can emulate elements from all of them, depending on its particular industry, context, and objectives. </p>

      </div>
    </div>
    <h3 class="sm black">Establishing mentorship or exchange programs to build leadership talent</h3><p>For acquirers whose main objectives include leadership development, one tactic involves pairing high-potential managers from the acquired company with an executive from the parent company as a coach and mentor. This helps build alignment between the acquirer and the acquired. The frequent and direct communication between leaders at both entities—without having to go through middle management—also allows for tighter coordination. </p><p>
When in 2002 Japanese automaker Suzuki Motor acquired a majority stake of Indian company Maruti Udyog, Suzuki engineered change at the top. It appointed a Suzuki executive as president and CEO of Maruti and took over 6 of the 11 board seats. But it also promoted four high-potential Maruti leaders—in sales, marketing, R&D, and administration—to corporate-officer roles and assigned each a functional executive from Suzuki as a mentor. The pairs were held jointly accountable for formulating new strategies. If postacquisition performance is any indication, the mentorship program has worked: Maruti’s sales have quadrupled, and profits are up 17 times from 2002 levels. </p><p>
Another promising tactic is two-way dispatch of executives (from acquirer to target and vice versa). When Takeda acquired US pharmaceutical company Millennium in 2008, it engineered an exchange of personnel to facilitate mutual understanding of corporate cultures. It invited Millennium’s CEO to join Takeda’s management team. Researchers from both companies traveled between Japan and the United States to strengthen their research capabilities. In 2011, Takeda transferred several Millennium researchers to its new research center in Japan. And Takeda recently named Millennium’s head of strategy—a Westerner—as head of business development for Takeda, showing the company’s openness to high-potential leaders from its subsidiary. Thanks to Millennium, which has been put in charge of all oncology efforts at Takeda, the company is now preparing to begin trials of three or four cancer-drug candidates per year—a significant increase from historical levels. </p><p>
These talent-development programs signal to foreign executives that the parent company is willing to invest in their professional advancement, giving them confidence that they can break through the perceived glass ceiling. </p><h3 class="sm black">Creating a special coordination unit at the division level</h3><p>
Another model entails the creation of a dedicated coordination office or unit to manage the integration. Depending on the company’s objective, the unit can be large or small. A large coordination office may make sense if there is a strong appetite for capturing value from cost synergies (by streamlining operations) and revenue synergies (by launching new initiatives that leverage both companies’ strengths). If the goal is intervention in one or two functions, a smaller, SWAT-type team may be more apt. In either case, the model helps avoid a leadership gap in postacquisition management. With a dedicated team, there is no question as to who is leading the integration effort. Toshiba acquired US-based Westinghouse Electric in 2006 to raise Toshiba’s global presence in nuclear generation. Toshiba sought to influence Westinghouse while also allowing it a degree of autonomy—which was critical, since the two companies had different types of nuclear technology. Toshiba set up two coordination offices: one within Westinghouse, whose members were drawn from Toshiba and its strategic partners Shaw Group and IHI (both of which had minority stakes in Westinghouse), and another within Toshiba. The offices worked together on strategy development and implementation. Three years later, Toshiba had record orders, including its first US orders for two large-scale projects. </p><p>
Hitachi Construction Machinery took a slightly different tack when it acquired a majority stake in Indian construction-equipment manufacturer Telcon, a joint venture with Tata Motors, in 2010. With the goal of increasing the quality of Telcon’s products, Hitachi dispatched seven Hitachi experts to the Telcon functions that needed fundamental change, such as quality assurance and product design. This specialist team, which was expanded in 2010, had full authority to direct Telcon’s performance-improvement efforts and created plans to optimize manufacturing processes, support services, and employee training. By creating a dedicated team, a company can begin to build internal skills that will prove useful in subsequent acquisitions. In the best cases, the individuals chosen for the coordination office are high-potential executives with excellent communication skills and business savvy. </p><h3 class="sm black">Developing local trainers as change agents</h3><p>In the third model, the front line is the focus of change. Employees from the foreign company are brought to Japan for “train the trainer” sessions that are more than a means of technology transfer— they also become opportunities to promote Japanese corporate values and management philosophy. These sessions help create a sense of belonging among the acquired employees that can, in turn, lead to greater motivation and higher employee-retention rates. </p><p>
When a Japanese manufacturer acquired a Southeast Asian company in 2006, it became the industry’s second-largest player. The acquirer was deliberate in how it chose to transfer its technology to its new subsidiary: it abandoned its traditional system of sending senior Japanese engineers to overseas subsidiaries to serve as trainers. Instead, select employees from the acquired company came to Japan for training, then returned to their home countries to train local employees. Approximately 700 non-Japanese employees have now undergone training in Japan; 60 of them have gone on to further study and been designated expert trainers. Although the Japanese corporation suffered along with the rest of the industry during the economic crisis, the combined company was recently able to beat the market leader for a high-profile contract—an achievement in which the new subsidiary played a critical role. </p><p>
By choosing not to dispatch its own employees but rather to bring in employees from the acquired company, Japanese companies can create room for “translation”: the change agents at the new subsidiary come to understand the corporate strategy and the vision for the integrated entity, and they develop a greater understanding of and appreciation for the technical advantages that each company offers. These change agents become effective champions of Japanese techniques and practices. </p><h3 class="sm black">Implementing company-wide culture-infusion programs</h3><p>
To infuse Japanese business culture into an acquired company, acquirers can launch initiatives that differ completely from those preceding them and ensure frequent communication on all fronts (for example, through employee newsletters or town halls). The most effective initiatives appear to be informal mechanisms that model Japanese norms while also bridging the divide between management and the front line. Company-wide programs, implemented correctly, can help motivate and retain target-company employees.</p><p>Suzuki, for instance, gave all Maruti employees sufficient exposure to Suzuki’s unique way of doing things. It promoted an open corporate culture, which was foreign and jarring in the Indian context. Top management and employees eat in the same cafeteria. Everyone, from the CEO to the factory worker, wears the same uniform to work. All employees—again, including the CEO—participate in morning exercise routines. (Although several Japanese companies hold dear the ritual of morning exercises, no others, to our knowledge, have introduced it at a non-Japanese subsidiary.)</p><div class="articleBreak"></div><p>These case examples should give Japanese executives the confidence to venture beyond Japan’s borders. Our findings indicate that there are a variety of promising approaches to postacquisition management and that leaders of Japanese companies must develop their own winning approach—sometimes through trial and error and constant refinement. Their first step should be to compile a list of acquisition targets that make sense given their strategic intentions. They should then come up with guiding principles and a blueprint for a postacquisition-management approach, tailored to their company’s strengths and the key value drivers of the industry. Japanese companies can—and indeed, if they want to grow, must—go global.<br /></p><div class="about-authors"><h3 class="sm black">About the authors</h3><p><b>Keiko Honda</b> is a director in McKinsey’s Tokyo office, where <b>Keith Lostaglio</b> and <b>Genki Oka</b> are partners.</p></div>]]></content:encoded>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>China is innovating.</strong> Some of its achievements are visible: a doubling of the global percentage of patents granted to Chinese inventors since 2005, for example, and the growing role of Chinese companies in the wind- and solar-power industries. Other developments&mdash;such as advances by local companies in domestically oriented consumer electronics, instant messaging, and online gaming&mdash;may well be escaping the notice of executives who aren&rsquo;t on the ground in China.</p>
<p>As innovation gains steam there, the stakes are rising for domestic and multinational companies alike. Prowess in innovation will not only become an increasingly important differentiator inside China but should also yield ideas and products that become serious competitors on the international stage.</p>
<!--roadblock-->
<p>Chinese companies and multinationals bring different strengths and weaknesses to this competition. The Chinese have traditionally had a bias toward innovation through commercialization&mdash;they are more comfortable than many Western companies are with putting a new product or service into the market quickly and improving its performance through subsequent generations. It is common for products to launch in a fraction of the time that it would take in more developed markets. While the quality of these early versions may be variable, subsequent ones improve rapidly.<a href="http://www.mckinsey.com/~/#" class="link-footnote" onclick="return false;" rel="#footnote1"><sup>1</sup></a> <span class="tooltip" id="footnote1" style="display: none;"><span class="footnote-content"><span class="footnote-number">1.</span><span class="footnote-text"> Commercialization differs from <i>shanzhai</i>, or &ldquo;copycat innovation.&rdquo; Many executives in the developed world misunderstand <i>shanzhai</i>, believing that it is purely the replication of an innovation developed in another market. Although this does occur, products developed through the <i>shanzhai</i> approach incorporate features specifically for the Chinese market. <i>Shanzhai</i> is quite prevalent in consumer products categories such as packaged goods and electronics. It can also be found in the business-to-business domain, where local companies produce knockoffs of successful foreign products or business models. </span><span class="clear"></span></span><span class="footnote-bottom"></span></span></p>
<p>Chinese companies also benefit from their government&rsquo;s emphasis on indigenous innovation, underlined in the latest five-year plan. Chinese authorities view innovation as critical both to the domestic economy&rsquo;s long-term health and to the global competitiveness of Chinese companies. China has already created the seeds of 22 Silicon Valley&ndash;like innovation hubs within the life sciences and biotech industries. In semiconductors, the government has been consolidating innovation clusters to create centers of manufacturing excellence.</p>
<p>But progress isn&rsquo;t uniform across industries, and innovation capabilities vary significantly: several basic skills are at best nascent within a typical Chinese enterprise. Pain points include an absence of advanced techniques for understanding&mdash;analytically, not just intuitively&mdash;what customers really want, corporate cultures that don&rsquo;t support risk taking, and a scarcity of the sort of internal collaboration that&rsquo;s essential for developing new ideas.</p>

      <table  cellspacing="0" cellpadding="1" border="1">
        <tr><td><p>
In innovative sectors such as biotechnology, electric vehicles, pharmaceuticals, and solar energy, the number of patent applications from Chinese companies is rising. In fact, Huawei and ZTE ranked among the world’s top five corporate patent registrants by volume in 2010. Intensifying patent activity reflects a growing recognition that intellectual property is essential to value. As this mentality takes hold, domestic innovators may pressure the government to create a more modern intellectual-property system.</p><p>
Currently, China recognizes three categories of patents: invention (what most people elsewhere think of as worthy of a patent), utility (a new use for something that already exists), and design. Invention patents run for 20 years, the others only for 10. Patent reform—such as reducing the duration of design or utility patents and raising the bar for what can be registered in those categories—would be a powerful way for the Chinese government to signal its seriousness about promoting indigenous innovation. If China decides to move ahead with patent reform, a desire for global consistency could well make it a high-priority multilateral issue.</p><p>Without patent reform, companies must rely on one of two strategies for protecting intellectual property. The first is to continue to outrun the competition by developing increasingly innovative solutions or building in protection through complex integration that is difficult to reverse-engineer. The second is to create easily identifiable technology “signatures” that would be hard to refute in legal proceedings.</p></td></tr>

    </details></p>
    
<p>Multinationals are far stronger in these areas but face other challenges, such as high attrition among talented Chinese nationals that can slow efforts to create local innovation centers. Indeed, the contrasting capabilities of domestic and multinational players, along with the still-unsettled state of intellectual-property protection (see sidebar, &ldquo;Improving the patent process&rdquo;), create the potential for topsy-turvy competition, creative partnerships, and rapid change. This article seeks to lay out the current landscape for would-be innovators and to describe some of the priorities for domestic and multinational companies that hope to thrive in it.</p>
<h3>China&rsquo;s innovation landscape</h3>
<p>Considerable innovation is occurring in China in both the business- to-consumer and business-to-business sectors. Although breakthroughs in either space generally go unrecognized by the broader global public, many multinational B2B competitors are acutely aware of the innovative strides the Chinese are making in sectors such as communications equipment and alternative energy. Interestingly, even as multinationals struggle to cope with Chinese innovation in some areas, they seem to be holding their own in others.</p>
<h3 class="sm black">The business-to-consumer visibility gap</h3>
<p>When European and US consumers think about what China makes, they reflexively turn to basic items such as textiles and toys, not necessarily the most innovative products and rarely associated with brand names.</p>
<p>In fact, though, much product innovation in China stays there. A visit to a shop of the Suning Appliance chain, the large Chinese consumer electronics retailer, is telling. There, you might find an Android-enabled television complete with an integrated Internet-browsing capability and preloaded apps that take users straight to some of the most popular Chinese Web sites and digital movie-streaming services. Even the picture quality and industrial design are comparable to those of high-end televisions from South Korean competitors.</p>
<p>We observe the same home-grown innovation in business models. Look, for example, at the online sector, especially Tencent&rsquo;s QQ instant-messaging service and the Sina Corporation&rsquo;s microblog, Weibo. These models, unique to China, are generating revenue and growing in ways that have not been duplicated anywhere in the world. QQ&rsquo;s low, flat-rate pricing and active marketplace for online games generate tremendous value from hundreds of millions of Chinese users.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s keeping innovative products and business models confined to China? In general, its market is so large that domestic companies have little incentive to adapt successful products for sale abroad. In many cases, the skills and capabilities of these companies are oriented toward the domestic market, so even if they want to expand globally, they face high hurdles. Many senior executives, for example, are uncomfortable doing business outside their own geography and language. Furthermore, the success of many Chinese models depends on local resources&mdash;for example, lower-cost labor, inexpensive land, and access to capital or intellectual property&mdash;that are difficult to replicate elsewhere. Take the case of mobile handsets: most Chinese manufacturers would be subject to significant intellectual property&ndash;driven licensing fees if they sold their products outside China.</p>
<h3 class="sm black">Successes in business to business</h3>
<p>Several Chinese B2B sectors are establishing a track record of innovation domestically and globally. The Chinese communications equipment industry, for instance, is a peer of developed-world companies in quality. Market acceptance has expanded well beyond the historical presence in emerging markets to include Europe&rsquo;s most demanding customers, such as France T&eacute;l&eacute;com and Vodafone.</p>
<p>Pharmaceuticals are another area where China has made big strides. In the 1980s and 1990s, the country was a bit player in the discovery of new chemical entities. By the next decade, however, China&rsquo;s sophistication had grown dramatically. More than 20 chemical compounds discovered and developed in China are currently undergoing clinical trials.</p>

<p class="grayNote small">Workers produce solar-cell modules in a factory in China&rsquo;s Jiangsu Province.<br>&copy; Imaginechina/Corbis</p>
<p>China&rsquo;s solar- and wind-power industries are also taking center stage. The country will become the world&rsquo;s largest market for renewable-energy technology, and it already has some of the sector&rsquo;s biggest companies, providing critical components for the industry globally. Chinese companies not only enjoy scale advantages but also, in the case of solar, use new manufacturing techniques to improve the efficiency of solar panels.</p>
<p>Success in B2B innovation has benefited greatly from friendly government policies, such as establishing market access barriers; influencing the nature of cross-border collaborations by setting intellectual-property requirements in electric vehicles, high-speed trains, and other segments; and creating domestic-purchasing policies that favor Chinese-made goods and services. Many view these policies as loading the dice in favor of Chinese companies, but multinationals should be prepared for their continued enforcement.</p>

<p>Despite recent setbacks, an interesting example of how the Chinese government has moved to build an industry comes from high-speed rail. Before 2004, China&rsquo;s efforts to develop it had limited success. Since then, a mix of two policies&mdash;encouraging technology transfer from multinationals (in return for market access) and a coordinated R&amp;D-investment effort&mdash;has helped China Railways&rsquo; high-speed trains to dominate the local industry. The multinationals&rsquo; revenue in this sector has remained largely unchanged since the early 2000s.</p>
<p>But it is too simplistic to claim that government support is the only reason China has had some B2B success. The strength of the country&rsquo;s scientific and technical talent is growing, and local companies increasingly bring real capabilities to the table. What&rsquo;s more, a number of government-supported innovation efforts have <i>not</i> been successful. Some notable examples include attempts to develop an indigenous 3G telecommunications protocol called TDS-CDMA and to replace the global Wi-Fi standard with a China-only Internet security protocol, WAPI.</p>
<h3 class="sm black">Advantage, multinationals?</h3>
<p>Simultaneously, multinationals have been shaping China&rsquo;s innovation landscape by leveraging global assets. Consider, for example, the joint venture between General Motors and the Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation, which adapted a US minivan (Buick&rsquo;s GL8) for use in the Chinese market and more recently introduced a version developed in China, for China. The model has proved hugely popular among executives.</p>
<p>In fact, the market for vehicles powered by internal-combustion engines remains dominated by multinationals, despite significant incentives and encouragement from the Chinese government, which had hoped that some domestic automakers would emerge as leaders by now. The continued strength of multinationals indicates how hard it is to break through in industries with 40 or 50 years of intellectual capital. Transferring the skills needed to design and manufacture complex engineering systems has proved a significant challenge requiring mentorship, the right culture, and time.</p>
<p>We are seeing the emergence of similar challenges in electric vehicles, where early indications suggest that the balance is swinging toward the multinationals because of superior product quality. By relying less on purely indigenous innovation, China is trying to make sure the electric-vehicle story has an ending different from that of its telecommunications protocol efforts. The government&rsquo;s stated aspiration of having more than five million plug-in hybrid and battery electric vehicles on the road by 2020 is heavily supported by a mix of extensive subsidies and tax incentives for local companies, combined with strict market access rules for foreign companies and the creation of new revenue pools through government and public fleet-purchase programs. But the subsidies and incentives may not be enough to overcome the technical challenges of learning to build these vehicles, particularly if multinationals decline to invest with local companies.</p>
<h3>Four priorities for innovators in China</h3>
<p>There&rsquo;s no magic formula for innovation&mdash;and that goes doubly for China, where the challenges and opportunities facing domestic and multinational players are so different. Some of the priorities we describe here, such as instilling a culture of risk taking and learning, are more pressing for Chinese companies. Others, such as retaining local talent, may be harder for multinationals. Collectively, these priorities include some of the critical variables that will influence which companies lead China&rsquo;s innovation revolution and how far it goes.</p>
<img alt="China high-speed train" src="http://www.mckinsey.com/~/media/McKinsey/dotcom/Insights/Asia-Pacific/A CEOs guide to innovation in China/ChinaTrain.ashx?mw=510">
<p class="grayNote small">A Chinese-built high-speed train at the Wuhan Railway Station, in Wuhan, China.<br>&copy; Guo Xulei/Xinhua Press/Corbis</p><h3 class="sm black">Deeply understanding Chinese customers</h3>
<p>Alibaba&rsquo;s Web-based trading platform, Taobao, is a great example of a product that emerged from deep insights into how customers were underserved and their inability to connect with suppliers, as well as a sophisticated understanding of the Chinese banking system. This dominant marketplace enables thousands of Chinese manufacturers to find and transact with potential customers directly. What looks like a straightforward eBay-like trading platform actually embeds numerous significant innovations to support these transactions, such as an ability to facilitate electronic fund transfers and to account for idiosyncrasies in the national banking system. Taobao wouldn&rsquo;t have happened without Alibaba&rsquo;s deep, analytically driven understanding of customers.</p>
<p>Few Chinese companies have the systematic ability to develop a deep understanding of customers&rsquo; problems. Domestic players have traditionally had a manufacturing-led focus on reapplying existing business models to deliver products for fast-growing markets. These &ldquo;push&rdquo; models will find it increasingly hard to unlock pockets of profitable growth. Shifting from delivery to creation requires more local research and development, as well as the nurturing of more market-driven organizations that can combine insights into detailed Chinese customer preferences with a clear sense of how the local business environment is evolving. Requirements include both research techniques relevant to China and people with the experience to draw out actionable customer insights.</p>
<p>Many multinationals have these capabilities, but unless they have been operating in China for some years, they may well lack the domestic-market knowledge or relationships needed to apply them effectively. The solution&mdash;building a true domestic Chinese presence rather than an outpost&mdash;sounds obvious, but it&rsquo;s difficult to carry out without commitment from the top. Too many companies fail by using &ldquo;fly over&rdquo; management. But some multinationals appear to be investing the necessary resources; for example, we recently met (separately) with top executives of two big industrial companies who were being transferred from the West to run global R&amp;D organizations from Shanghai. The idea is to be closer to Chinese customers and the network of institutions and universities from which multinationals source talent.</p>
<h3 class="sm black">Retaining local talent</h3>
<p>China&rsquo;s universities graduate more than 10,000 science PhDs each year, and increasing numbers of Chinese scientists working overseas are returning home. Multinationals in particular are struggling to tap this inflow of researchers and managers. A recent survey by the executive-recruiting firm Heidrick &amp; Struggles found that 77 percent of the senior executives from multinational companies responding say they have difficulty attracting managers in China, while 91 percent regard employee turnover as their top talent challenge.</p>
<p>Retention is more of an issue for multinationals than for domestic companies, but as big foreign players raise their game, so must local ones. Chinese companies, for example, excel at creating a community-like environment to build loyalty to the institution. That helps keep some employees in place when competing offers arise, but it may not always be enough.</p>
<p>Talented Chinese employees increasingly recognize the benefits of being associated with a well-known foreign brand and like the mentorship and training that foreign companies can provide. So multinationals that commit themselves to developing meaningful career paths for Chinese employees should have a chance in the growing fight with their Chinese competitors for R&amp;D talent. Initiatives might include in-house training courses or apprenticeship programs, perhaps with local universities. General Motors sponsors projects in which professors and engineering departments at leading universities research issues of interest to the automaker. That helps it to develop closer relations with the institutions from which it recruits and to train students before they graduate.</p>
<p>Some multinationals energize Chinese engineers by shifting their roles from serving as capacity in a support of existing global programs to contributing significantly to new innovation thrusts, often aimed at the local market. This approach, increasingly common in the pharma industry, may hold lessons for other kinds of multinationals that have established R&amp;D or innovation centers in China in recent years (read about&nbsp;AstraZeneca&rsquo;s experience in &ldquo;Three snapshots of Chinese innovation&rdquo;). The keys to success include a clear objective&mdash; for instance, will activity support global programs or develop China-for-China innovations?&mdash;and a clear plan for attracting and retaining the talent needed to staff such centers. Too often, we visit impressive R&amp;D facilities, stocked with the latest equipment, that are almost empty because staffing them has proved difficult.</p>
<h3 class="sm black">Instilling a culture of risk taking</h3>
<p>Failure is a required element of innovation, but it isn&rsquo;t the norm in China, where a culture of obedience and adherence to rules prevails in most companies. Breaking or even bending them is not expected and rarely tolerated. To combat these attitudes, companies must find ways to make initiative taking more acceptable and better rewarded.</p>
<p>One approach we found, in a leading solar company, was to transfer risk from individual innovators to teams. Shared accountability and community support made increased risk taking and experimentation safer. The company has used these &ldquo;innovation work groups&rdquo; to develop everything from more efficient battery technology to new manufacturing processes. Team-based approaches also have proved effective for some multinationals trying to stimulate initiative taking (read about&nbsp;General Motors&rsquo; approach in &ldquo;Three snapshots of Chinese innovation&rdquo;).</p>
<p>How fast a culture of innovation takes off varies by industry. We see a much more rapid evolution toward the approach of Western companies in the way Chinese high-tech enterprises learn from their customers and how they apply that learning to create new products made for China (read a perspective on the&nbsp;evolution of its semiconductor sector in &ldquo;Thee snapshots of Chinese innovation&rdquo;). That approach is much less common at state-owned enterprises, since they are held back by hierarchical, benchmark-driven cultures.</p>
<h3 class="sm black">Promoting collaboration</h3>
<p>One area where multinationals currently have an edge is promoting collaboration and the internal collision of ideas, which can yield surprising new insights and business opportunities. In many Chinese companies, traditional organizational and cultural barriers inhibit such exchanges.</p>
<p>Although a lot of these companies have become more professional and adept at delivering products in large volumes, their ability to scale up an organization that can work collaboratively has not kept pace. Their rigorous, linear processes for bringing new products to market ensure rapid commercialization but create too many hand-offs where insights are lost and trade-offs for efficiency are promoted.</p>
<p>One Chinese consumer electronics company has repeatedly tried to improve the way it innovates. Senior management has called for new ideas and sponsored efforts to create new best-in-class processes, while junior engineers have designed high-quality prototypes. Yet the end result continues to be largely undifferentiated, incremental improvements. The biggest reason appears to be a lack of cross-company collaboration and a reliance on processes designed to build and reinforce scale in manufacturing. In effect, the technical and commercial sides of the business don&rsquo;t cooperate in a way that would allow some potentially winning ideas to reach the market. As Chinese organizations mature, stories like this one may become rarer.</p>
